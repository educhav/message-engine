Samuel Adams,Is it fair to say that Harvester of Sorrow is Metallica's heaviest song
Samuel Adams,Both in rhythm and lyrical content
Degan Nestrichal,fight fire with fire
Samuel Adams,"That's their most thrashy for sure, Dyer's Eve being a close second"
Samuel Adams,But HoS has ridiculous headbang potential especially when they play it live and pause like 30 seconds before the last verse
Degan Nestrichal,i see there is a difference
Elijah Parker,Literally half a second
Elijah Parker,Oh wait never mind just over a second
Degan Nestrichal,damn if J was there he woulda helped him get below 1 second
Elijah Parker,Hardly even have time to say I'm.
Elijah Parker,okay so are we having a super bowl party then?
Samuel Adams,I'm probably gonna be home for the super bowl
Samuel Adams,You boys should plan something though that would be epic
Degan Nestrichal,fuck no!!! I can't look like I'm not knowledgeable in football for a few hours!! It would ruin my reputation as a sub-119 IQ citizen of the Great American Youth!
Samuel Adams,Holy shit! Tom Brady is the greatest lineman that has ever played handball!
Degan Nestrichal,sam which flag is this
Degan Nestrichal,its for an assignment
Elijah Parker,Zimbabwe I think?
Degan Nestrichal,no
Samuel Adams,Nah it's an Arabic country
Elijah Parker,Fuck
Samuel Adams,I believe it's Jordan?
Samuel Adams,"Actually, it's Palestine"
Samuel Adams,Israel would tell you that's not a real country =^)
Degan Nestrichal,that would make sense its from a scifi film where the middle east deadlock results in the entire middle east being split up by elevator floors
Samuel Adams,Sounds interesting actually
Samuel Adams,What film is this
Degan Nestrichal,just a short film on vimeo
Elijah Parker,On that note I fuckin love this entire album of Scar's.
Elijah Parker,Angry British man.

Elijah Parker,I'm not clicking that link mate
Degan Nestrichal,trust no one
Samuel Adams,"It's like a mix of deathcore, pop, nu metal, and Queen-esque classic rock"
Samuel Adams,How the fuck
Degan Nestrichal,eli it could have been worse it could have been cavity to cavity
Degan Nestrichal,heres the actual vid if u trust that
Degan Nestrichal,that fucking transition has me wheezing still lmao
Elijah Parker,I thought that looked a lot like denzel
Elijah Parker,I thought I was just racist for a second.
Degan Nestrichal,well eli now u have something to send to ur worst enemies
Elijah Parker,I'm not saving that lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,it will have the rap thumbnail so it would be discrete
Elijah Parker,Fuckin lil Uzi vert is ass bro idk how that dude is so popular. You'd think if you were going on a cypher you'd actually have something to say or planned at all ahead.
Elijah Parker,"Half the words he said were ""yeah"""
Degan Nestrichal,is everyone just a giant or is lil uzi vert lil
Elijah Parker,He's like 5'3 I think.
Elijah Parker,"Fuck one off. 5'4"""

Elijah Parker,Denzel is pretty sick yeah.
Degan Nestrichal,You sent an attachment.
Elijah Parker,Idk if I can trust that.
Elijah Parker,Especially since it's reddit.
Degan Nestrichal,its top post on instantkarma
Elijah Parker,Alright it's fine then.
Elijah Parker,Lmfao fuck.
J Cole Patt,Jesus christ seeing drama unfold is fucking hilarious.
J Cole Patt,Watching this dude cheat and talk shit abt his girl just to cry to her later.
J Cole Patt,And she forgives and the cycle repeats.
J Cole Patt,This is fucking amazing.

J Cole Patt,litterally rn
J Cole Patt,wait nvm
J Cole Patt,its the 7th
Samuel Adams,It's Sunday at 5:30
Austin Medina,Lets all sneaky sneak into sams dorm
J Cole Patt,thatd be fun
J Cole Patt,we could tag team a couple hoes
J Cole Patt,1.6 percent of the us is fully vaccinated
J Cole Patt,Perhaps we shall get rid of the virus soon
Austin Medina,Man i love my civic i just gotta get better at driving it lmao
Austin Medina,Eventually i want a real race car tho
J Cole Patt,rip
Austin Medina,Tf
Austin Medina,That looks painful
J Cole Patt,its a tatoo
Austin Medina,Sam should i buy a na miata and turbo it
Austin Medina,O shit no way
Samuel Adams,Of course
J Cole Patt,"Sam, should I join isis?"
Austin Medina,kinda wanna buy an evo after seeing my friend tylers
Austin Medina,theyre siqq as fuqq
Degan Nestrichal,this is my fav crossover
Samuel Adams,Holy shit
Samuel Adams,Who knew Tekashi and Creed Fisher had so much to relate on?!
Degan Nestrichal,im still reviewing different technologies to see what to do for armory
Degan Nestrichal,"itd prob be most effective as a desktop application firstly, as the startup costs for storage space especially as the project expands could be difficult"
J Cole Patt,armory
J Cole Patt,As in
J Cole Patt,War shit
Degan Nestrichal,audio repository maximizing original recording yield
J Cole Patt,I have no clue what thaf is
J Cole Patt,But hit me up if u want like
J Cole Patt,Shit abt wae ig idk
Degan Nestrichal,ok ill make sure to hit u up for shit abt wae
Samuel Adams,We're creating a platform where you can basically constantly update a song as you go and the old version of the song is retained for future reference and so on
J Cole Patt,"Like, a app?"
Samuel Adams,So that old recordings aren't useless and you can still consult them for something cool you might've done before that should make the final cut
Samuel Adams,Hence maximizing recording yield
J Cole Patt,thats p neat
J Cole Patt,bruh this bit cut on my arm aint healing
Degan Nestrichal,lol rip u
J Cole Patt,Big*
J Cole Patt,Fkn
J Cole Patt,Ye
J Cole Patt,It aint bleeding tho so im gucci
J Cole Patt,"Wait shit, this isnt self harm"
J Cole Patt,"This is just a cut i have received, i do not mean in that way"
J Cole Patt,Kek
J Cole Patt,Nah man but on a different topic
J Cole Patt,Old recordings are def good in the terms of old shit isnt bad
J Cole Patt,Wouldnt you just need to set it up so you can like
J Cole Patt,Just trim and add it into the video?
J Cole Patt,And it just saves the old?
Samuel Adams,It's a little more complicated than that
Samuel Adams,You know how we have a video on the MR facebook page of us attempting six different takes or so of seven nation army
Degan Nestrichal,its similar to git's version control system is what im thinking but with song structure
J Cole Patt,Im certain it id.
J Cole Patt,is.
Degan Nestrichal,"so instead of no structure with git its like chorus, bridge, verse #, etc."
Samuel Adams,There was something unique about every single take that could merit further evaluation but the normal way to do these things is just to discard the old takes and consistently try to improve it every time without realizing the good things that each take had
J Cole Patt,"yoyoyo niggas, hop in tge gay"
Samuel Adams,"The end goal, I presume, is to create some kind of smart software that can detect differences in song structure and alert the user to them but that is well beyond the scope of any of our abilities atm"
Degan Nestrichal,yeah..
J Cole Patt,shit what
J Cole Patt,That sounds
Samuel Adams,I only know it's possible because Shazam can detect songs
J Cole Patt,Very difficult.
Degan Nestrichal,that reminds me when i was talking to my sisters the other day and they legit have no idea how massive some of the projects they are describing to me are
Samuel Adams,And I doubt Shazam is open-source
Degan Nestrichal,they were like you should make a google maps but for truckers :o
J Cole Patt,"Yeah in terms of coding, it sounds very difficult."
J Cole Patt,Lmao
J Cole Patt,Map the entire planet eddie
Samuel Adams,"Exactly, so the first iterations of this project are going to be very user-input oriented"
J Cole Patt,And write code for it.
Elijah Parker,"Night, guys."
Degan Nestrichal,@ eli
Elijah Parker,I actually did end up staying later than I wanted to yeah.
Elijah Parker,But I did so cleaning at least. :):)
Elijah Parker,But now it's really schleep time.
Degan Nestrichal,fuck this guy is gonna kick my ass if i ever burn his flag!
Elijah Parker,lmao Eddie u look so sleepy in the corner.
Samuel Adams,When Drake tried to claim racism didn't exist
Elijah Parker,Of course Drake tried to claim it wasn't real bro he's white!
J Cole Patt,Rip
Elijah Parker,"""I've never gotten cancer, therefore cancer doesn't exist"""
Elijah Parker,That's literally the same mentality.
Samuel Adams,"Well if you can't find a source of racism, chances are 1. you're blind to it and/or 2. you're the source of it"
Samuel Adams,In this case Drake was both
Elijah Parker,I mean that's fair too.
Elijah Parker,"That or you're one of those dudes that's completely racist but try to hide it behind offensive ""jokes"" and claim that's all it is is a joke."
Elijah Parker,Lmao good fuck this dude.
J Cole Patt,"Listen man, ill admot, words can be racism, but using them doesnt neccessarily make you racist."
J Cole Patt,While its definitly certain that people are getting soft snd such words shouldnt be used in public. But if your in a private setting you should always have free speech.
Samuel Adams,It's not so much that I care what Drake says as much as he's being hypocritical by trying to claim that racism doesn't exist because he's never seen it
J Cole Patt,Because hes white.
J Cole Patt,And has money
Elijah Parker,But to say it doesn't exist while saying words specifically meant to keep a different race down he's also a fuckin idiot.
J Cole Patt,Shit drake got police on his side with shit.
Elijah Parker,No he doesn't.
Elijah Parker,Drake's FAMILY does.
Samuel Adams,Yknow it's been over a year since we've mingled with Drake
Samuel Adams,"The whole ""I'm gonna call the fucking cops on you Eddie"" thing happened January of 2020"
Elijah Parker,Wait what
Elijah Parker,Lmfao he said he was gonna call the cops on eddo?
J Cole Patt,P sure the police contacted eddie as well
Samuel Adams,They did lmao
Elijah Parker,Oh wait yeah.
J Cole Patt,Im down for harrasing drake again.
Samuel Adams,I think I can pull up the voicemail too
Elijah Parker,For the shit he posted on reddit lmao.
J Cole Patt,Make it a yearly thing lmao
Elijah Parker,Bro.
Elijah Parker,I wanna hear this voicemail lmfao.
Elijah Parker,We should ask him if he's moved on from using black slurs to Asian slurs or something.
Elijah Parker,"""what's up Drake you call anyone a gook lately?"""
Elijah Parker,Sam you got the voicemail though? ð
Elijah Parker,ððð
J Cole Patt,universoty police
J Cole Patt,MR drake fox
Elijah Parker,Drake seems like the type of dude to say people are getting soft until someone insults him.
Elijah Parker,Then he literally calls the cops pfft
Samuel Adams,No that's quite literally the dynamic
Samuel Adams,He was fine with talking about other people but then when people return the favor he gets fuckin tilted
Elijah Parker,"""Ugh I know I just told this family they were nothing more than scum I wipe off my boots but they didn't need to call me a tiny fairy faggot :(:("""
Elijah Parker,Eminem???
Samuel Adams,Holy shit it's Hailey Mathers
J Cole Patt,Feminem

Degan Nestrichal,is that about manifest destiny
J Cole Patt,What
Elijah Parker,Not really. It's a Chinese novel from back in the 16th century about a group traveling to india to obtain sacred Buddhist tomes.
Degan Nestrichal,the imperialist idea that God mandates the colonization of the west
J Cole Patt,"""ye, im raiding ur shit cuz god told me to lol"""
Elijah Parker,all of the crusades.
Degan Nestrichal,i see
Austin Medina,basically what i need the tool for is so that i can remove tires quickly lmao
Austin Medina,and also rebolt them quickly
Degan Nestrichal,i learned that my gay scifi literature class is basically ignoring that HP lovecraft ever existed because he was a white supremacist and blah blah
J Cole Patt,Racist exist
Degan Nestrichal,god liberals are so gay
Elijah Parker,It's actually pretty decent. Idk if you've ever heard of a character called Sun Wukong or The Monkey King but this is a story with him.
J Cole Patt,Racist look like this
Elijah Parker,He's something of a folk hero in China.
Austin Medina,"cuz a big part of my job will be doing tire rotations which is where u remove the wheels and rotate them to different axle depending on the drive train, this is done to even out the wear on the tires and make them last longer"
Austin Medina,also i gotta inspect stuff like brakes and such so sometimes you need to take off the wheels
Elijah Parker,Also that's fucking stupid HP Lovecraft was the GOAT and inspired pretty god only knows how much modern science fiction.
Austin Medina,but at the same time idk if my boss is actually gonna make this shit happen or not this is the second time he's mentioned me moving up and not shit has happened
Austin Medina,so we will see
J Cole Patt,Biggest racist of us all
Elijah Parker,The racism boss.

J Cole Patt,He isnt
J Cole Patt,I couldve sworn he was
Elijah Parker,I told you.
Degan Nestrichal,contact JJ altho he is prob too busy doing a karl marx cum tribute atm
Degan Nestrichal,@JJ Joseph
Degan Nestrichal,sam what are ur thoughts on madison nixing lovecraft from the scifi genre because he was a white supremacist
Degan Nestrichal,*scifi curriculum u get it tho
Samuel Adams,One can separate the art from the artist
Samuel Adams,"Charles Manson had some cool songs, Phil Spector produced some of the most influential records ever, doesn't mean they were good people"
Degan Nestrichal,its just to the point where its practically misinformation by censorship
Samuel Adams,"And it's worth evaluating his horror because his racism came from the same place, it's a way to understand people and that he was frightened of other races which led to his hatred"
Degan Nestrichal,the way she describes him in lecture is just as a vehement white supremacist
Samuel Adams,"That is misinformed, because even so there's a lot to be learned from Lovecraft's works"
Samuel Adams,But shit I don't need to tell you this lol
Samuel Adams,We can't pander to people forever
Samuel Adams,Someday there's going to be some heinous event in American history that can't be brushed aside as mere black-or-white morality and what are these people gonna do
Degan Nestrichal,idk most of the text ive read from lovecraft hasnt had any blatant white supremacy. Maybe a lack of inclusion but it was the 1920's
Samuel Adams,Nah he had a poem called the origin of nwords or something like that and it's blatantly racist
Degan Nestrichal,oh ik im just saying most of his popular texts // the ones relating to the cthulhu mythos
Samuel Adams,But we can read it through the lens of âRacism and horror can be correlated because they both stem from some kind of fearâ which doesn't trivialize who he was but rather takes what is useful
Degan Nestrichal,"ya know i have heard of that correlation between his depiction of foreigners or a different culture and his beliefs, but i feel like its just speculative, which is all literature studies tbh"
Degan Nestrichal,if you just take his stories at face value they are definitive horror fiction
Degan Nestrichal,hop on teh gay if knowledgeable about niggas in paris
Samuel Adams,I have to fucking SHOVEL god FUCK
Austin Medina,Ive been working outside all day cuz this dumb bitch that i work with called in like the wop he is
Austin Medina,So yeah im all alone at work today trying to do everything im about to call his ass out cuz he shouldve and couldve been here

Austin Medina,Also starting to stash tools so i can be a mechanic ð¤ð¤
Austin Medina,"Nah im a porter rn i just do all kinds of shit that needs to be done like cleaning, parking cars, giving people rides, delivering parts"
Elijah Parker,Dude I actually got an ad on youtube not too long ago talking about a program where you can get ur mechanic degree in less than a year.
Austin Medina,I just do whatever my advisors say
Elijah Parker,I mean that's fair.
Austin Medina,Yeah i got accepted into gateway in keno but idk when Im actually gonna go or if im even gonna
Elijah Parker,Gateway is pretty decent. I wanted to go there for a while and had a free ride but it didn't work out.

Elijah Parker,Sam you and I tomorrow have to do that.
Elijah Parker,I'll race u.
Degan Nestrichal,we should speedrun any% eli getting into a barfight
Elijah Parker,"Give me booze, insult me and send me on my way"
Elijah Parker,I'll find a way.
Samuel Adams,When Eli loses himself in the bottle he is the most powerful force in the universe
Degan Nestrichal,im wondering how easy it would be to cheat on an online test if i were to take it on a virtual machine
Degan Nestrichal,i wonder if honorlock detects virtualization
Elijah Parker,lmao
Degan Nestrichal,holy shit this is sam and his fantasy gf on the left!
Degan Nestrichal,iirc at one point he was considering leaving rachel for her
Degan Nestrichal,shit if we are doing this tmrw wuts the plan @Austin Medina @J Cole Patt @Elijah Parker
Elijah Parker,Like I said I don't have cable in my room but if someone could find a way to get the super bowl on my TV I'm down to have you guys over.
Elijah Parker,Idk if youtube TV would work for something like that but they've got a free trial I could use if so.
Degan Nestrichal,well no im pretty sure the plan would be to go to J's house
Degan Nestrichal,but idk no one has said anything
Degan Nestrichal,or J hasnt
Elijah Parker,That's the issue though is if it's supposed to be J's place we don't even know if he's cool with that.
Degan Nestrichal,well thats why im saying this now
Degan Nestrichal,cuz no one has said anything
Degan Nestrichal,@J Cole Patt @Austin Medina
Elijah Parker,In the absolute worst case I'll figure something out.
Degan Nestrichal,if u guys dont respond in an hour i will drink all the liquor
Elijah Parker,And yes I could hook up youtube TV for the superbowl and then just end my subscription right after.
Elijah Parker,So that's a viable option if @J Cole Patt can't have us over for whatever reason.
Elijah Parker,especially because youtube TV has an xbox app.
Degan Nestrichal,well im drinking all the liquor if these faggots dont respond!
Elijah Parker,oh damn.
J Cole Patt,que paso

Degan Nestrichal,ill leave it up to austin
Degan Nestrichal,idk if no one wants to do it then w/e
Elijah Parker,idek when the Super bowl starts.
Elijah Parker,I mean I'd like to chill with you guys but I don't really have an interest in the super bowl specifically.
Degan Nestrichal,i have to study anyways
Elijah Parker,Alright man if that's what you'd prefer to do I getchu.
Samuel Adams,Chances are I will be able to host big shindigs in the coming months
Samuel Adams,"Assuming my dad's case works out and it looks like it will, we'll be able to fix up the rest of the shit we wanna fix and it'll be a grand old time"
Samuel Adams,Because otherwise it's a damn shame to have a nice basement just to yourself
Degan Nestrichal,i hope this isnt a false promise like most politicians!
Degan Nestrichal,either its a false promise or summer 2021 is gonna fuck
Elijah Parker,Damn man that fuckin sucks I was really hoping to hang out with you guys.
Elijah Parker,I cancelled plans and shit.
Degan Nestrichal,"I'm right as rain, but sam is all to blame!"
Degan Nestrichal,nah im jk but we can hangout another time
Elijah Parker,ig

J Cole Patt,I could use a little liqor
Degan Nestrichal,this is just a ploy for u to get booze
J Cole Patt,=(
J Cole Patt,it is but at least im honest
Austin Medina,Fucking hell the cats are keeping me up
Samuel Adams,"In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies!"
Degan Nestrichal,lol ur so edgy layne!
Degan Nestrichal,let the sun never blind your eyes
Degan Nestrichal,let @Austin Medina sleep so his teeth dont grind
Samuel Adams,Oh prithee my dear won't you try to understand
Samuel Adams,I'm giving it all I've got cause I've got no other plan ð¥µ
Samuel Adams,Oh fuck Grafton's gonna fucking kill me!
Degan Nestrichal,lol i like how this guy thinks that ppl are gonna have to personally come to their homes and take their weapons
Samuel Adams,Her name is rio and she dances on the sand!
Samuel Adams,One of the most fun basslines to play
Austin Medina,I still havent gotten my foid card
Austin Medina,Its been 8 months
Degan Nestrichal,this b austin

Degan Nestrichal,J can u not sleep without the sounds of cheeks clapping balls
J Cole Patt,No
Samuel Adams,I haven't felt like this in so long!
Degan Nestrichal,have you ever tried getting laid? ððð
J Cole Patt,yes
J Cole Patt,Doesnt work
J Cole Patt,just gonna end up sitting there trying not to wake the other person up.
JJ Joseph,Yes but there is typically no wind so it doesn't feel as cold as it can get here
JJ Joseph,At least to the Finnish girl I talked/talk to
Austin Medina,Damn nigga its cold as everliving fuck
Degan Nestrichal,JJ matches with tinder hoes all across the globe respeck
JJ Joseph,Nah she was an exchange student that my uncle in iowa was hosting they
Degan Nestrichal,lame af
Degan Nestrichal,i lost all respeck
JJ Joseph,Why because I get a steady supply of international bitches
JJ Joseph,Jk lmao but they are usually pretty nice I really got along well with the Finnish gril
Samuel Adams,I want a Finnish gf who will raise 12 children with me let's make it happen
JJ Joseph,Lmao
JJ Joseph,Ya we talked the entirety of whenever she came over lol
Degan Nestrichal,this is historical moment in gamer historee
JJ Joseph,Heck
Degan Nestrichal,"this will confuse the future historians that will assume JJ was a breach main, when in fact he was a brimstone main"
Austin Medina,Alright nigga idk abt yall but im staying in the fuckin crib
Austin Medina,Its -10
Austin Medina,My cars barely started
Degan Nestrichal,austin the plans have been called off do u not read niqqa
Austin Medina,No
Austin Medina,I dont
Austin Medina,My dumb cunt cats were up fighting all night
Austin Medina,Smh
JJ Joseph,I didn't read it either lmao
Degan Nestrichal,jeez how r u guys ever gonna be scholar chads when u dont red the groop chet
JJ Joseph,I thought it said farting there for a second
JJ Joseph,Literally read it as my dumb cunt cats were farting all night
Degan Nestrichal,lol just split them up austin its so ez
Degan Nestrichal,lock one in the closet all night and leave one outside
JJ Joseph,You could try to give them separate places like crate or just someplace for them not close together so they can have some alone time idk just an idea
Degan Nestrichal,lol i was watching this dodo video of this 34 lb cat who got fat cuz her owner had alzheimers and kept forgetting whether or not they had fed them
Austin Medina,They start scratching at doors and meowing so either way theyre annoying me
JJ Joseph,My grandma with dementia basically did the same thing to my dog. She thought there were two dogs trixie and fritsie so when she snuck food to one she had to give it to the other too
Degan Nestrichal,lol she thought there were 2 dogs when there was only 1?
JJ Joseph,Ya she had dementia where your mind seems to melt infront of you and your family where you forget who everyone is not recognize any of your children friends or family slowly descending into a constant state of confusion and anxiety feeling like you wake up in a new place every day when you have lived there for years to then have your brain forget how to literally function going into a sort of comma that ends with you suffocating to death because you seemingly don't know how to breath anymore
Degan Nestrichal,do ppl with dementia actually die because they forget how to breathe?
JJ Joseph,Your brain doesn't function properly
JJ Joseph,Its aerating which is typically also caused by loss of blood vessels in the brain
JJ Joseph,Deteriorating*
JJ Joseph,That is the kind of dementia my grandma had where blood can't reach the brain from strokes
JJ Joseph,And yes even without those you can forget how to breath in dementia and Alzheimer's
JJ Joseph,But this happenes only right before you die for typically in a coma so you don't really expirence it
Degan Nestrichal,yeah i see
JJ Joseph,Sorry for going off its just something that hits me hard since she had to live with us the majority of my life and I had been helping care for her since I was in the 3rd grade
Samuel Adams,Alzheimer's is the absolute worst disease
J Cole Patt,"hey sam, have you talked to that guy at all?"
Austin Medina,man i want a fucking racecar
Austin Medina,or i might just get a bike i would have to learn to drive it tho
Samuel Adams,I haven't talked to Gerald no
Samuel Adams,I was meaning to at some point
J Cole Patt,Kek just womdering
Samuel Adams,Also @Austin Medina TB is a fucking chad
Samuel Adams,Jawing up tyrann mathieu lmao
Austin Medina,Pat mahomes will carry them
Samuel Adams,He has been making some ridiculous plays but it's just not enough
Samuel Adams,Tyrann Mathieu may have singlehandedly lost the game for the chiefs today
Degan Nestrichal,fuck yeah superbowl!!! this is what americans do!!! go packers!!!
Degan Nestrichal,"sam and austin are so far down the consumer chain that they will never achieve self-actualization! How embarrassing, lol!"
J Cole Patt,8 penalties man
J Cole Patt,95 yards jfc
Samuel Adams,It was more than that
Samuel Adams,The Chiefs defense absolutely shit the bed today
Samuel Adams,And the buccaneers were fucking Mahomes because he didn't have all his starters on offensive line
J Cole Patt,RIP
J Cole Patt,They got like 8 pemalties mam
J Cole Patt,dogecoin at 7 cents
J Cole Patt,Bough 50 bucks worth at 5 cents
J Cole Patt,I turned 50 bucks into 70 so far
J Cole Patt,Look at me bois
J Cole Patt,Stonks
Samuel Adams,I should put more into it
J Cole Patt,You should have
Samuel Adams,It's not too late you know
J Cole Patt,Im a bit scared of it crashing but i dont rhink it will.
J Cole Patt,If u got money to waste go for it.
J Cole Patt,I have 1000 stocks of it
J Cole Patt,Its grest
Samuel Adams,Dogecoin to 1 dollar
Samuel Adams,I'd have 111 bucks
Degan Nestrichal,dogecoin is getting popularity from the bottom feeder normies because 3 celebrities endorsed it on twitter today!
Samuel Adams,Just the more reason to profit amirite
Samuel Adams,I have no skin in the game after all these are my free stockbux
Degan Nestrichal,of course without bottom feeder normie consoomers the world would be bankrupt
Samuel Adams,My equity is up to 7 dollars now
Samuel Adams,"8 dollars, even"
Samuel Adams,It will spiral out of control I promise you
Degan Nestrichal,1st
Degan Nestrichal,reply to sems vid
Degan Nestrichal,lol he said dicks!
Degan Nestrichal,sam what did i say about 4th generation consumerism
Degan Nestrichal,u will never achieve self-actualization if u continue to live in the 4-5th levels of the media consumer chain!
Samuel Adams,I glimpsed self-actualization and got so scared I willingly condemned myself to 4th generation consumerism
Degan Nestrichal,oh i was unaware of this revelation
Samuel Adams,It's much easier to care about menial things like football games and what your next meal might be than the meaning of oneself and our ulterior motives
Samuel Adams,"And in some ways, you become what you think about, it is meta self-actualization"
Degan Nestrichal,right on brother i just live life as it cums ð
Degan Nestrichal,at the bottom of the consumer chain is the kid listening to what his dad heard on facebook from some neckbeard in an RV talking about plandemic and pizzagate
Samuel Adams,Life will cum whether you think about it or not so why think about it owo
Degan Nestrichal,that is true 100% redpill is too depressing
Degan Nestrichal,shit J gonna get a robo drug dealer
Degan Nestrichal,i kinda want to get my feet wet with robotics
Degan Nestrichal,teh problem with getting into a lot of different fields related to programming is that there are no beginner tips for ppl who already know how to program so all the beginner shit is elementary
Degan Nestrichal,how to learn machine learning in 2021 from scratch!
Degan Nestrichal,learn how to program first pleb
Degan Nestrichal,id assume that arduino micocontroller kits is probably a good start tho
Degan Nestrichal,what have u been delving into recently sam outside of skool
Degan Nestrichal,i remember u told me about an ebow u got for christmas
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, mostly music has been the pursuit lately"
Elijah Parker,The superbowl was trash from what little I saw of it.
Samuel Adams,It was entertaining but maybe just because I wanted Thomas Brady to win kek
Elijah Parker,Even the half time show I couldn't hear the weeknd at all lmao. I heard like 3 words of all his songs. Idk if anyone else had the same issue but his mic must have been fucked.
Samuel Adams,Nah a lot of people are complaining about the mic issues too
Samuel Adams,The mixing didn't do him any favors
Elijah Parker,I heard something about Kenny G possibly being the half time show so I was intrigued as fuck.
Elijah Parker,Nothing like some soulful jazz music from me by the time I hit the age of 50.
Elijah Parker,Instead I was disappointed and couldn't even hear the actual performance. :(:(
Degan Nestrichal,ya know i think i heard metallica something something during the superbowl
Degan Nestrichal,the name
Degan Nestrichal,dunno what that was about but wow!
Elijah Parker,Dude Metallica are the Jewish guys who wear the white and black face paint duh!
Elijah Parker,The one has a super long tongue and they dress like Disney villains bro I'm surprised you haven't heard of them before bro you must live under a rock bro.
Degan Nestrichal,i think u r describbing gene simmons and KISS idiot!
Elijah Parker,No mate ur stupid that's metallica bro obviously!
Elijah Parker,@Samuel Adams Whatchu think about Robert Johnson mate.
Samuel Adams,I love Robert Johnson
Samuel Adams,I love delta blues in general
Samuel Adams,"Blind willie mctell, blind willie Johnson, charley patton, son house, etc"
Samuel Adams,That music is where you get closest to raw human emotion
Elijah Parker,I find it kinda fucked people made up a rumor about the dude selling his soul to the devil likely just because he was a black guy that was fucking phenomenal at something.
Elijah Parker,Same though mate. I've been getting more into blues and jazz recently.
Samuel Adams,Did you watch the same Netflix documentary me Eddie j and Austin did lol
Samuel Adams,"I was familiar with Robert Johnson before that though, I've always loved his music"
Degan Nestrichal,was this the guy that played turned away from the crowd
Degan Nestrichal,that like improved rapidly
Elijah Parker,"Nah actually I was just letting youtube music random play songs and he came up so I was like ""wait this is back in the 30s and the only two albums he ever recorded ððð sounds like something I should check out"""
Samuel Adams,"And then from delta blues you can hear the birth of rock, lightnin hopkins, john lee hooker, sister rosetta tharpe"
Elijah Parker,Wait you just reminded me you're signed into Netflix on my xbox hell yeah.
Samuel Adams,And yeah that was him Eddie
Elijah Parker,Aww poor lad had stage fright :(:(
Samuel Adams,"He actually had the opposite problem, he was so eager to play he annoyed people before he was good at it"
Elijah Parker,Apparently he went from a novice to total mastery in like 2 years.
Samuel Adams,Guitarist at a party syndrome
Samuel Adams,Reason he had his back to the audience is so that would be copycats couldn't see what he was playing
Elijah Parker,Ayyyy that's smart as fuck tbh.
Elijah Parker,But yeah no imagine being that guy and just being so invested into guitar you master it in two years and people claim literally the devil is the reason you got good and not your will and passion for it.
Samuel Adams,There's this guy named Alan lomax who went into the heart of the delta to record a lot of these blues singers and he's the reason we have these recordings
Elijah Parker,God bless that man.
Samuel Adams,"The extent of segregation was such that he was essentially entering another society culturally, he gave a lot of cool insight into Jim Crow era black culture"
Samuel Adams,And how striking it had developed/mutated since slavery
Samuel Adams,"If I was a sociologist I'd do my fuckin master's dissertation on this, it's probably my favorite part of American history"
Elijah Parker,I'll have to see if I can't get a biography of his as well sometime tomorrow.
Elijah Parker,Ayyy never mind then I'll just talk to you about it.
Samuel Adams,I'm not as knowledgeable on this topic as I'd like to be
Samuel Adams,My resources are pretty much Wikipedia and YouTube lol
Elijah Parker,But no I've been on Bioshock kick lately and with it my interest in the music and culture of the 20s-60s has come as well.
Samuel Adams,"But you can hear him interacting with these old black guys and asking them about their lives, where they learned to play, etc"
Samuel Adams,My favorite guy of the bunch is probably blind willie mctell
Elijah Parker,I'm kinda intrigued about learning the guitar tbh.
Samuel Adams,"Give searching the desert for the blues a listen, it's almost got a pop sensibility to it by my modern ears's standards"
Elijah Parker,Lmfao I'll have to do that. Hold on.
Samuel Adams,"And then if you want to be depressed listen to dark was the night, cold was the ground by blind willie Johnson"
Samuel Adams,A song so forlorn it ended up on the voyager golden record and is currently outside of the solar system
Elijah Parker,The aliens need to hear that song too? Fuck I've gotta give that one a listen after this one.
J Cole Patt,cussy
Elijah Parker,"I've definitely heard Dark was the night, cold was the ground before. I didn't know who sung it at the time or even the name but I've definitely heard it before somewhere."
Elijah Parker,I'm about a minute into it and I'm trying to figure out where I've heard it before.
Elijah Parker,And Nobody's Fault but Mine but again I can't remember where.
Elijah Parker,I remember the name of that one though.
Samuel Adams,Led Zeppelin does a version of Nobody's Fault but Mine which is arguably the most popular version of the song
Samuel Adams,But as you delve into the blues you realize how big of plagiarists Led Zeppelin were lmao
Samuel Adams,Half of their first two albums are Willie Dixon covers
Elijah Parker,It's okay bro they're white!
Elijah Parker,My biggest question right now is was Blind Willie Johnson actually blind though? ð
Samuel Adams,He was
Elijah Parker,Fuck fair enough then.
Elijah Parker,Wait.
Samuel Adams,"When he was younger, his mom threw lye in his face or something to that extent"
Elijah Parker,He figured out how to play the guitar by himself as a blind man?
Samuel Adams,"I don't know if he learned it by himself but yeah, he was blind by the time he learned how to play"
Elijah Parker,Damn bro what a Chad.
Elijah Parker,Nah I remember the original recording of Nobody's Fault but Mine. I remember his voice singing it. I'm listening to it rn lol
Samuel Adams,Leadbelly's also a chad
Samuel Adams,He was perfectly at the gap between delta bluesmen and more modern guys
Elijah Parker,It seems like a lot of the Delta Blues guys were chads tbh.
Elijah Parker,"One of them was blind and still learned to play guitar like that, one of them mastered the guitar in two years and could play so well people swore he sold his soul."
Elijah Parker,Like bro what's in the water down there in Mississippi bro.
Samuel Adams,"Suffering, slavery without being called slavery, poverty"
Elijah Parker,And they still made fuckin BANGERS bro.
Elijah Parker,I've gotta see where I've heard that song before or it's gonna keep me awake.
Elijah Parker,"I looked up ""Nobody's Fault but Mine"" and led zeppelin's song came first fuck ð­"
Samuel Adams,Totally unrelated but I love this fuckin song
Elijah Parker,Is rhat Michael cera in the middle
Samuel Adams,No but if they ever did a biopic about America he's a dead ringer for him lmao
Elijah Parker,Dude that legit just looks like fuckin Michael cera with a mullet.
Elijah Parker,Scott Pilgrim's music career took off 3 decades before he joined Sex Ba-Bomb bro.
Samuel Adams,Every time I write an acoustic song that's a downer I hope I can capture something of this vibe
Samuel Adams,"A wistfulness to it, like ""Fuck I'm glad that happened but I'm displeased it's over"" etc"
Elijah Parker,Motherfucker
Elijah Parker,It's fuckin bioshock 2 that I've heard that song ð­
Samuel Adams,Had no idea bioshock 2 was so cultured
Elijah Parker,Bro no lie Bioshock has some fuckin BANGERS on the OSTs
Elijah Parker,"1, 2 and infinite all have fuckin great OSTs no lie."
Elijah Parker,1 has a few Ink Spots songs and a few Bing Crosby songs.
Samuel Adams,I'm going to dump some good songs before I go to sleep
Elijah Parker,Send them to me in pms mate
Samuel Adams,Bet
Elijah Parker,I wanna be able to not have them get drowned out in the GC lol
J Cole Patt,"yo sam, def talk to gerald and such abt le music"
J Cole Patt,He was asking abt u n such.
J Cole Patt,Didnt really give him a str8 answer because of like
J Cole Patt,"Its ur music, u should presentate it the way u see fit, not me."
Samuel Adams,I've been wanting to reach out to him but I don't really know what to say
Samuel Adams,Also boys 1 year ago today we played at J's grandparents place for what we didn't know would be the last time for a while lmao
Samuel Adams,I put 10 bucks of my own flesh and blood cash into doge which I don't really care if I totally lose
Samuel Adams,However I have 20 dollars of equity so I've doubled my worth fuck with me
Austin Medina,Now imagine doing that with ten gs
Austin Medina,Thats the hard part about making money in stonks is getting enough money to make big gains
Samuel Adams,It can definitely turn into an avalanche if you keep reinvesting your earnings
Samuel Adams,But most people aren't warren buffett mfs lol
Austin Medina,Warren Buffett makes most of his money off value investing and dividends but you dont need billions to make good money
Austin Medina,But yeah it can avalanche but it would take a lot of things going right
Samuel Adams,I wanna invest in Chinese forex
Samuel Adams,If they're gonna outpace us in industry I might as well jump on the bandwagon xd
Austin Medina,Fuk china
Samuel Adams,I'm giving China some of my freedom bucks in exchange for more freedom bucks if they use them wisely and/or follow the trend
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna have the most diverse possible portfolio
Austin Medina,You can overdiversify tho bruv
Samuel Adams,"Robotics, aerospace, cannabis, China, pharmaceuticals, and crypto I literally can't fail ð"
Samuel Adams,Lmao yeah I know
Samuel Adams,I don't even have the funds to actually do this anyway
Austin Medina,Get a job
Austin Medina,"And buy auto sector, its gonna grow as evs become the norm"
Samuel Adams,I have a job and it's bitching about not having one
Austin Medina,Be a part time porter bro ez money
Austin Medina,The sales porters at my job literally work only about 40 percent of the time maz
Austin Medina,Max
Samuel Adams,I say this every summer but I think legitimately this is the summer I get my license and start working like a normal individual
Austin Medina,The rest of the time them niggas smoke weed and play video games
Austin Medina,Ill help you get your license bru
Samuel Adams,Also I found out the Escape is just FWD big gay
Austin Medina,Austins driving school for the blind and retarded is now open
Austin Medina,Is it rly lmao
Samuel Adams,Makes me wanna get rid of it and look for a better car when I have the means to do so
Austin Medina,Oh well fwd is better than rear for winter time
Austin Medina,Just buy my jeep ill give it to you for 2400 cash money
Samuel Adams,"That's true, and it won't really matter when conditions are good"
Samuel Adams,"The jeep would be sick honestly, you've documented the work you've done on it quite a bit lol"
Austin Medina,Im doing more soon i have to change the radiator because its leaking
Samuel Adams,How about I give you the escape and pay you more for taking it off my hands ð¥´ð¥´
Austin Medina,The only thing thats big gay about the jeep is that it has that squeaky belt
Austin Medina,"Lmao idk i dont like fords, except mustangs and diesel trucks those are swag"
Samuel Adams,My dad has expressed interest in eventually getting an F350
Samuel Adams,"I wonder if he'd finally kick his Focus to the curb, he's had that thing for like a decade now"
Samuel Adams,"F350s are crazy mfs, they can carry something like 3 tons"
Samuel Adams,And tow far more than that
Austin Medina,Yeah i fw any diesel truck i didnt realize how reliable they are until now
Austin Medina,Honestly tho for your first car you cant go wrong with honda and toyota
Austin Medina,"Most of their cars are damn near invincible, you could run a honda motor without coolant or oil and it would still drive for like 10 mins, most other motors would lock up"
Samuel Adams,Ever since you explained vtec to me I was like damn Honda's got it going on
Samuel Adams,Small motors but powerful little mfs
Austin Medina,Just buy honda civic ðºðºðºð¹ð¹
Austin Medina,Now some of the motors are powerful but most are just made for efficiency
Austin Medina,"If you want a decent vtec motor it has to be dual overhead cam, the sohc designs only have vtec rocker arms and cams for the intake or exhaust valves"
Austin Medina,"Like mine for example at like 3500 rpm, vtec kicks in but it only affects the intake valves, not the exhaust, so it doesnt make that huge of a difference"
Samuel Adams,I wanna get a toyota hilux only because they are the african warlord's truck of choice
Austin Medina,"The honda b & k series motors are typically pretty good, the way honda motors are designated are with a letter like D followed by two numbers that denote the displacement"
Austin Medina,"For example mine is a d17, d series 1.7L"
Austin Medina,"Hell yeah, toyotas are swag too"
Samuel Adams,Yeah lemme get a pickup truck and not actually use it for anything lmao
Austin Medina,If youre gonna get a civic you want to go fast you gotta either swap the motor or get a SI model with a dohc
Samuel Adams,That's how we'll start our trash collection company Austin
Austin Medina,Just use it to help your friends move
Samuel Adams,That would be siq too
Samuel Adams,As we're all within 3-5 years of getting our own places if sleepy joe doesn't FUCK the economy!
Samuel Adams,I'll probably move back home after college though tbh rent is pretty brutal
Austin Medina,Just save up and buy a house ez clap
Samuel Adams,Lemme get an adjustable rate mortgage that starts at 0 interest so I can move out scott free within the first 5 years
Samuel Adams,Life is a game and we're just playing it
Samuel Adams,Dude remember when Ian Anderson rolled up to school driving one of these? It was so fucking poggers!
Degan Nestrichal,austin no one wants to buy ur stwag for 2400!!
Degan Nestrichal,also any car is good for a beginner normie
Degan Nestrichal,just gotta get from point A -> point B
Austin Medina,Kinda
Samuel Adams,"I was gonna say there's some nuance to it, but it really comes down to what you intend to do with the car I guess"
Austin Medina,But just know if you buy a used range rover from 1999 for 1200 bucks you arent gonna get to point b too many times before it takes a shit
Degan Nestrichal,most of the things that are important for a normie are the superficial things like good heating and brakes
Austin Medina,Did you just call brakes superficial nikka wtf LMAO
Degan Nestrichal,anything i can see on a normal drive be superficial austin
Degan Nestrichal,that kinda be the definition of superficial
Samuel Adams,The most important things for a normie to do is to remove their catalytic converter
Degan Nestrichal,god everyone is so retarded except for me in particular
Samuel Adams,Ricer time
Austin Medina,Lmak
Austin Medina,Lmao
Austin Medina,Im actually kinda worried abt ur car eddie you defo need a brake job
Austin Medina,Lemme inspect them shits sometime and see if i can see anything wrong in particular
Austin Medina,You dont gotta do the shit im just curious
Degan Nestrichal,its like how a PC normie is more likely to care about peripherals and FPS > ddr4 speed and cpu clock speed
Degan Nestrichal,also i still dont see what is wrong with my brakes lmao
Austin Medina,That pulsation is usually a sign of low brake pad material or warped rotors
Austin Medina,Could also be something with your caliper
Austin Medina,Plus it didnt feel like it had a lot of stopping power at least compared to my jeeo
Austin Medina,Jeep
Degan Nestrichal,im too fkin inteligant to know what any of this means ð¡
Austin Medina,Bruh
Austin Medina,Brake pad rubs on the rotor
Samuel Adams,"Somebody came by while Austin was doing his car build and static shocked it, totally fried the whole thing :("
Austin Medina,The pad material is made of ceramic and resin content that wears down over time from rubbing on the rotors
Degan Nestrichal,austin make sure not to rub ur feet on carpet while working on a tesla!
Austin Medina,Yes sir
Austin Medina,Since youre a ford family just buy a mustang @Samuel Adams
Degan Nestrichal,austin for the avg normie consooming car retard folk such as myself dee only thing that matters is dat it runs and has heat
Austin Medina,"Get a gt or better tho, v6 mustangs are for women and old people"
Austin Medina,"Well thats all that really matters to me too, which is why i said honda and toyota because they are renowned for reliability even if you dont maintain them"
Degan Nestrichal,yes sam just money launder on the dark web to save up for a mustang!!
Austin Medina,Thats what i did
Austin Medina,I actually found a shelby cobra gt500 for sale for like 35k at a dealership by chicago it was in really good shape
Austin Medina,Seemed like a good deal
Samuel Adams,A mustang would be sick even if it's a meme car
Austin Medina,Ehhh every car has memes tho
Austin Medina,Like for instance my honda is a racing lawnmower
Degan Nestrichal,sam will literally forget how to drive straight as soon as he gets a mustang
Samuel Adams,Lmao on the contrary that's all it can do
Degan Nestrichal,he gonna be on the top page of r/idiotsincars
Austin Medina,Sam annihilates a crowd of spectators at a car show
Degan Nestrichal,lmao ive seen that
Samuel Adams,Mustangs and other such muscle cars are rocket ships with wheels
Degan Nestrichal,ford mustangs are the best device to commit a mass murder with
Samuel Adams,They don't have maneuverability for shit but the fastest way anywhere is a straight line
Samuel Adams,This is especially true of the Mach 1 models from the late 60s
Samuel Adams,"Pre-power steering, those things were nasty daily drivers lmao"
Austin Medina,"Thats why i wanted to get that mr2 because its actually rear engine, damn near perfect weight distribution so it would have perfect handling"
Austin Medina,Straight line speed is dank too tho tbh
Degan Nestrichal,austin capitalism is the worst thing to ever happen to technology!
Samuel Adams,I would get a toyota celica but the blinker fluid for it is discontinued :(
Degan Nestrichal,ive realized this over the past couple of weeks!
Austin Medina,Lol eddie probably has to refill his airbag too
Degan Nestrichal,jokes on u i never will get into a car accident!
Degan Nestrichal,austin im telling u bro cancel ur insurance its a good luck charm
Samuel Adams,Austin just got a fat hardon! Oh my god!
Samuel Adams,You could get this mf with a 7 liter engine
Austin Medina,Im more into exotics
Austin Medina,Did i tell u my grandpa has a 69 chevelle ss with the 454 motor
Austin Medina,"Its getting pained rn, thing is absolutely mint"
Samuel Adams,That sounds dope
Austin Medina,We should hit up some car shows this year
Samuel Adams,How loud is that fuckin thing lol
Austin Medina,"Hella, i havent seen it in a while tho"
Samuel Adams,"I would be down, I used to go to this car and air show at the kenosha airport but they discontinued it years ago for whatever reason"
Austin Medina,That sucks we can just go to local shows tho
Austin Medina,I wish i had a legit sports car
Samuel Adams,Austin's gonna put this thing in his Civic
Austin Medina,Lmao that would totally fit
Samuel Adams,Yeah bro just extend the hood of your car another 8 inches no big deal
Austin Medina,Might as well buy an s2000
Austin Medina,I was legit thinking about getting an evo cuz you can finance one and daily it
Austin Medina,"Since its a 4 door with a trunk and all that, its still fast and looks great tho"
Degan Nestrichal,lol imagine spending this money on a car rather than a PC!
Degan Nestrichal,just buy a beater and move on with ur life god!
Austin Medina,Nah evos are too swag
Austin Medina,"Realistically i should stack cash and wait until im like 25 anyway, insurance would be insane on a car like that"
Degan Nestrichal,if (person.isMale() && (person.age <= 25 && person.age >= 16)) insuranceRate.goBrrr();
Degan Nestrichal,fk i leaked the source code of insurance companies
Austin Medina,Lol true i bet
Degan Nestrichal,i guarantee u that exact if statement is someone in their algorithm
Degan Nestrichal,*somewhere
Degan Nestrichal,but yeah wait to fantasize about cars when ur of age otherwise its pointless yearning!
Samuel Adams,No yearning is ever pointless you fucking boomer! AHHHHH
Degan Nestrichal,god u zoomers are what is wrong with america
Samuel Adams,In fact boomers had absolutely no plan for the future which is why the state of the world is as it is now xd
Degan Nestrichal,"keep watching tiktok and reddit hopelessly, sipping your starbucks and eating ur grubhub chipotle you sickening consuming bastard!"
Samuel Adams,Boo young people bad! Young people stupid and illiterate!
Samuel Adams,The youth are our ONLY FUCKING HOPE
Samuel Adams,"If we can't make it happen, then color our world blackened..... ;("
Degan Nestrichal,all zoomers know is watch tiktok and get student loan debt
Samuel Adams,We love being indebted to banks
Degan Nestrichal,then cry for bernard sanders to save u!! only god can u save u!! end ur life now!!
Austin Medina,Tbh imma keep my jeep for winter
Samuel Adams,Haha even if you end your life you won't find any purpose in heaven or hell! Existence is just pointless ennui no matter what form it takes! Better find something to put emphasis on before you disappear into the black forever!
Samuel Adams,"""I can't wait until I go to heaven!""
*goes to heaven*
""Now what"""
Degan Nestrichal,lol all catholics are economic idiots y pray to god all ur life when u can just repent on ur deathbed! like a pagan to anyone who will take them to heaven!
Degan Nestrichal,they are burning gas going to church that could be spent to invest in more tesla stock and turbo integra xD
Samuel Adams,"""Existence in heaven is so pointless, I can't wait for heaven 2""
*Heaven 2 comes out*
""Now what"""
Samuel Adams,The curse of the human condition is we are so prepared for dying that we can never fully be accustomed to living xd
Degan Nestrichal,"clear all ur sins, get born again! just repeat a couple of lines! of cocaine xD!!"
Degan Nestrichal,u gotta snort it in then exhale it back out
Degan Nestrichal,fr todd misinterpreted the lyrics of Get Born Again thats why he is a party animal buying drinks for 18 year old girls!
Samuel Adams,There's definitely pictures of Todd Belardi from the 90s hanging out backstage with alice in chains doing copious amounts of heroin
Degan Nestrichal,idk much about jesus but i wanna become a theology teacher!
Austin Medina,Tf are u negus talking about
Samuel Adams,You know that spongebob episode where squidward goes to live with people exactly like him and he enjoys it for a while until it wears on him that he's doing the same things every day and he can't tell any two days apart
Degan Nestrichal,austin is a smoothbrained normie wouldnt understand even if we stuck it up his ass!
Samuel Adams,That's what the afterlife is going to be like if you're christian! Lmao!
Austin Medina,I just want racecar
Degan Nestrichal,lmao what u described is a typical corporate work week
Austin Medina,Gotta get them stacks to buy a w12 swapped s2000
Samuel Adams,I am fully prepared for the typical corporate work week
Samuel Adams,The money will fund my dopamine receptors
Degan Nestrichal,austin u gotta learn to program so u dont have to work bluecollar jobs ever again!!
Austin Medina,"Its not so bad tbh, just grind your ass off and you will feel rewarded in knowing people think good things of you"
Austin Medina,"Bluecollar jobs are important too, gotta keep cars running and shit draining"
Degan Nestrichal,well yeah but do u really want to keep doing it for the next 20-30 years
Samuel Adams,"Nobody at a job really cares about you, it's all about your friends and family baby"
Austin Medina,Yeah lmao
Austin Medina,I love working on cars
Degan Nestrichal,and yeah work friends arent real
Degan Nestrichal,they are all a simulation
Samuel Adams,Well you can at least relate on the fact that most people are subconsciously thinking the same thing and all putting on the exact same facade
Austin Medina,Maybe not necessarily working on cars but working automotive like being an advisor or foreman
Austin Medina,"I actually like my people at work, i only would really hang out with like one of them but theyre all decent"
Degan Nestrichal,we do need foreskin men
Samuel Adams,"If the veil was pulled off and we could show the working class just how jaded they all are, we could unite them and instill real change in this country!"
Austin Medina,I actually did make a real friend in Tom at advance autoparts
Degan Nestrichal,idk ive always found work friends to be flaky as soon as ur off shift
Degan Nestrichal,its just communal suffering that brings u together
Samuel Adams,Topical
Degan Nestrichal,STOP DROWNING OUR COMMENTS WITH THIS SHITPOST!!
Austin Medina,I chill with tom outside of work hes pretty cool
Samuel Adams,Eddie is a full blown redditor and is beyond saving
Austin Medina,Yep
Austin Medina,Sorry bud we gotta put you down
Degan Nestrichal,sam i have 400 karma how can u call me a redditor
Degan Nestrichal,after a year and a half
Samuel Adams,"All this ""shitpost"" ""consoomer"" rhetoric is straight from the dregs of r/cringetopia!"
Austin Medina,The fact we dont know what that means and you do speaks volumes you dirty redditor
Samuel Adams,At least I have the decency to browse 4chan ;)
Austin Medina,I found a 01 gt for sale but its cash only for 15 grand FUCK
Austin Medina,Im just gonna keep driving my shitboxes
Austin Medina,Fug it
Degan Nestrichal,its from the anti-consumer push from linux users
Samuel Adams,Stop all consumption now
Degan Nestrichal,"I am literally better than all of you, yet you all are too stupid to realize it! God!"
Austin Medina,Ok
Austin Medina,Guess theres no point in trying
Samuel Adams,Stop paying for your internet service provider! Disconnect your utilities! Stop paying rent!
Austin Medina,"I actually worked out for the first time in a while, feels so good bruv"
Austin Medina,Gonna just start lifting again to fill the void
Samuel Adams,"You are literally consuming cubic feet of space from a landlord, that is fucking disgusting............"
Degan Nestrichal,sam this is the same way ppl criticize anarchists and libertarians for using the roads
Samuel Adams,And rightly so
Samuel Adams,Libertarians are knaves who enjoy a different flavor of ice cream oppression
Austin Medina,I hate people in positions of power they must perish
Samuel Adams,And anarchists have never read a book in their life
Austin Medina,Except christian von koenigsegg
Austin Medina,Hes okay
Degan Nestrichal,anti-consumerism is about minimizing being a puppet to corporations and capitalism! god you dont understand it sam!
Samuel Adams,"Honey, we got a letter in the mail, it says ""War Crimes Invoice"" from White House Inc., should we pay the bill?"
Austin Medina,Fuck the white house why isnt it the african american house
Samuel Adams,Yes because that corporation provides a lot of services for our city! They're almost like a gov--
Samuel Adams,OH GOD OH FUCK
Samuel Adams,Return to monke time
Degan Nestrichal,im sowwy for being mean to google and micwosoft that was bad of me ð¥º please use windows and eat ur google flavored hot pockets
Austin Medina,"Im gonna get panda express today, that shit is sooo fuggin good"
Degan Nestrichal,in 20 years we will all be eating amazon sandwiches with our sealed tesla soymilk!
Degan Nestrichal,"no but the anti-consumerism thing i dont take super-seriously just in respects where its possible i will, which most ppl should"
Degan Nestrichal,its mostly a meme making fun of zoomer techonology consoomers
Austin Medina,But but but but but were zoomers
Degan Nestrichal,i will never be like u austin
Austin Medina,"Anywhom, yeah sam if u wanna buy el jeepo once i fix it ill lyk, depending on good it feels after this summers repairs i may keep it"
Samuel Adams,"I don't mind the consumer culture per se, I've realized it's often a necessary distraction from the perils of self-actualization as I was talking about last night"
Austin Medina,Just gonna do the leaf spring and radiator
Degan Nestrichal,i dont either to a certain extent but it certainly has infiltrated the technological world
Samuel Adams,It's hard to enter a transcendental state if you convince yourself that no good will ever come of it so you might as well just live for yourself and those you have an immediate effect on
Degan Nestrichal,along with corporations
Samuel Adams,The washington-wall street network is fuckin nauseating
Samuel Adams,The entrenched elite are only digging themselves in more I can't wait until another GME situation never happens because the wall street cronies probably now have algorithms to detect which stocks are about to blow up based on online chatter
Samuel Adams,"If they didn't already, in which case this was even more remarkable"
Degan Nestrichal,i feel like people and engineers would make cooler shit if they werent bossed around by ppl who had no idea what they are talking about and only want to see physical results
Austin Medina,"I just wanna learn to work on cars bro fug, finding a good hobby to sink some time and money into is also okay imo, as long as youre not mindlessly throwing money at products"
Degan Nestrichal,corporate ignorance lets them control time!
Degan Nestrichal,like some fucking websites are getting so overbloated with javascript its gross
Degan Nestrichal,its legacy codebase to blame
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, the profit motive ruins things that would otherwise be great if they were given more time and attention"
Degan Nestrichal,ive started to realize a lot about software development and how most amazing programs are free and open-source and literally made by hobbyist-coders
Samuel Adams,"I've heard this about music too, that you should have a plurality of material before you even get signed by a major label or something to that effect because they're going to make demands of you that are often impractical or impossible, AIC being case-in-point with sludge factory"
Samuel Adams,"When I say I write songs I mean I usually record a verse, a chorus, some kind of instrumental, but almost never are they completed projects when I get down to it for the first time"
Samuel Adams,If I was doing this for money I'd be hard-pressed to try and finish every single one which leads to the creative well drying up and that's my theory for why a lot of music sounds the same these days
Degan Nestrichal,that song really is indicative of how detrimental corporations and capitalism is to art and engineering
Austin Medina,Hey sam
Austin Medina,I might get an accord ð¤
Austin Medina,Swag
Samuel Adams,What year

Austin Medina,Ive been buying all the tools i need it feels weird cuz its an intimidating industry but i feel right at home at the same time
Degan Nestrichal,worst case scenario i take an internship at uline but there is almost no way in hell im gonna work there after

Austin Medina,Learn to write your own code for the ecm to put out 2500 hp in a prius dumbass
Degan Nestrichal,ok why dont u learn how to capture carbon and claim elons bounty austin
Austin Medina,Im not that smart i just like cars and making money
Austin Medina,This is what i do
Austin Medina,I am jewish greek mejicano
Samuel Adams,It's not so much about finding what you want to do with your life and what you're gonna fill your time with
Samuel Adams,Tactics vs strategy
Austin Medina,Just find something that makes u wanna get up and work towards
Degan Nestrichal,no girl will ever love me other than austin ð¥º
Austin Medina,I dont even need girls i have exhaust pipes to stick my cok in
Degan Nestrichal,i feel like being a software engineer will probably make me not wanna even touch a computer when i get home
Degan Nestrichal,or maybe ill still be a hobbyist coder idk
Austin Medina,Ig its possible to get burnt out on anything yeah
Samuel Adams,That's why I diversify my interests so much
Degan Nestrichal,armory wont be completed until 2028!
Austin Medina,Thats why i diversify my portfolio so much
Samuel Adams,"I can readily talk about cars, music, history, pussy, money, weed! I'm so fucking cool!"
Degan Nestrichal,"by then the only music is the same mumble rap soundtrack on soundcloud, edited millions of times over by every single artist!"
Degan Nestrichal,"remember austin, overdiversification can be bad!"
Degan Nestrichal,this is almost patronizing
Austin Medina,My most recent purchase in stonks has been 188.5 shares of sundial growers which is a marijuana stonk
Degan Nestrichal,we have read 7 chapters of C the programming language in our class so far.. and this is the weekly participation program.. lol..
J Cole Patt,u finna lose money austin
Degan Nestrichal,sam can u do it for me thanks
Degan Nestrichal,J it doesnt matter if he loses money all that matters is that his dick feels tingly from the rush of online gambling
Samuel Adams,Invest in acreage holdings
Samuel Adams,They're gonna combine with another company when marijuana is federally legalized
Samuel Adams,Big money to be made ð
Austin Medina,Lol no im not
J Cole Patt,Did u buy when they were low or when they were at a fdollar?
Austin Medina,I bought when I was low and I bought when I was at a dollar I think it's going to grow either way marijuana's going to be a big industry for a long time
J Cole Patt,You are correct about it
J Cole Patt,dogecoin at 8 cents
J Cole Patt,I have made yet even more money of of my money
J Cole Patt,Rip
Austin Medina,I think weed is gonna be huge in the future once the government actually allows it at the federal limit im sure theres gonna be room for a lot of companies and providers given the demand for weed products
Degan Nestrichal,as long as ppl keep consuming it like sam the weed industry will be booming!
Austin Medina,Hell ya
Degan Nestrichal,holy fuck this guy got an entire mag unloaded on him and kept walking
Degan Nestrichal,pcp is one hell of a drug

Degan Nestrichal,some guy counted 12
J Cole Patt,Man these cops suck nowadays cuz they def could have gotten this man alive.
J Cole Patt,yeah but the gun was aimed in a way that he missed.
Degan Nestrichal,the guy behind the wheel was a sadist like wtf lmao
J Cole Patt,"""shoot his ass!"""
Degan Nestrichal,shit im surprised the cop didnt turn around and shoot him for being black!
J Cole Patt,the man walked up to a cop without any remorse and got shot.
J Cole Patt,lmao
J Cole Patt,Yeah if the dude got up and tried to hurt somekne else that woildnt be gucci
Degan Nestrichal,im almost certain a tazer wouldnt have done shit
J Cole Patt,Yeah
J Cole Patt,But the cop walking up to the man and pulljng a gun out prob didnt do anything.
J Cole Patt,mfw
J Cole Patt,when u get shot 4 times
Degan Nestrichal,man thought he was iron man til he ate 9 shots
J Cole Patt,Man the cop shouldnt have saved that round.
J Cole Patt,The man clearly bought sheilds
J Cole Patt,"The classic takes like 7 shots to fkn kill, ifs crazy"
Degan Nestrichal,this guy thought he used phoenix ult

Austin Medina,"Why are you getting downvoted for that, thats funng"
Austin Medina,Decent gain today
Degan Nestrichal,"because all redditors are soft liberals, thats why austin!"
Austin Medina,Maybe thats facts
Degan Nestrichal,they arent hardened anarchist chads like the two of us austin
Degan Nestrichal,we should make our own ideology chadism
Degan Nestrichal,degan nestrichal is totally not just coincidentally an anagram for anarchist legend
Samuel Adams,I originally thought that was the origin of the name kek
Degan Nestrichal,nestrichal came to me in a dream
Degan Nestrichal,then i remembered it the next day
Degan Nestrichal,just like samuel adams came to sams mom in her dreams two decades ago
Austin Medina,This dude at work is being a big dumb bitch
Austin Medina,Just cuz him and his girl broke up like nigga do ur job
Austin Medina,Niggar
Degan Nestrichal,just airdrop this to him
Austin Medina,He even left at 2pm idek why i think hes trying to get a better job but hes one of those ppl that never does what he says he will
Degan Nestrichal,that reminds of this one really weird trend i picked up on working at fast food
Austin Medina,Lmao whats that
Degan Nestrichal,ppl who start working and work enthusiastically and hard are always the ones who NCNS two weeks later.. like always
Austin Medina,Tf is ncns
Austin Medina,Oh no call no show
Degan Nestrichal,its like they dedicate so much in those 2 weeks then just burn out
Degan Nestrichal,its such a weird phenomena
Austin Medina,Thats kinda how i felt for a little while after i worked here but i just got out of that mojo and kept grinding and it pays off cuz all of my superiors like me and get along fine
Degan Nestrichal,the ones who are mopey ish and work decently are the ones that stick around in fast food
Austin Medina,I wouldnt wanna work in fast food i dont think i dont like working in cheap places
Austin Medina,After working in advance i realize how much it sucks working in low income areas
Degan Nestrichal,food service in general is ð¤®
Degan Nestrichal,like fk i remember how weird it felt constantly going from a hot grill to a cold freezer every 5 mins
Austin Medina,I like working here cuz its all rich old folk
Austin Medina,Every once in a while you get the weird ghetto mf that bought an old buick as a beater but thats fine
Degan Nestrichal,yes maybe if they are drunk enough u can convince them to leave u sole beneficiary of their millions
Austin Medina,Theyre easier to deal with lmao

Elijah Parker,How old is it?
Austin Medina,Theyre asking way too much nvm but its an 05

J Cole Patt,Ouch lmao
Degan Nestrichal,i dont want anyone else to major in CS its reserved for only elite intelligent aryan race
J Cole Patt,O ur aryan?
J Cole Patt,I mean
J Cole Patt,Im aryan as well
J Cole Patt,Aryan is german im p sure
Elijah Parker,No you're not.
Degan Nestrichal,"nah but programming is a good living, but u really gotta have the thinking paradigm for it"
Elijah Parker,Aryan is blonde haired and blue eyes.
Degan Nestrichal,programming can be monotonous for some ppl like austin who have an 8 second attention span and just want to chug mountain dew all day!
Elijah Parker,or this guy.
Austin Medina,I'm sorry I just I really like cars I can't help it okay god fuk
J Cole Patt,rip
J Cole Patt,Ive programmed b4
Degan Nestrichal,its ok i have an 8 second attention span whenever austin starts talking about cars
J Cole Patt,I love it kek
Degan Nestrichal,id assume he has the same attention span when i talk about Brogramming
Austin Medina,I tried to learn programming I learned a little bit of stuff okay it's just not that interesting to me sorry
Degan Nestrichal,apology NOT ACCEPTED AUSTIN!!
Degan Nestrichal,fuck you eternally!!
Degan Nestrichal,wut have u programming b4 j
Degan Nestrichal,*programmed
Degan Nestrichal,cuz basic procedural programming can be very different from larger scale object-oriented programs
Degan Nestrichal,"it gets quite cancer to regulate and maintain after a while, once ur project reaches a certain size"
Degan Nestrichal,austin how will u ever program ur own electric car
Austin Medina,I was thinking I wonder how hard it would be to learn to be a mechanic for tesla
Austin Medina,Some of the stuff will be Universal like Wheels tires suspension and brakes probably but the drivetrain is probably insanely hard to work on
Degan Nestrichal,thats more on the electrical/circuiting side
Austin Medina,Tesla currently still uses regular brakes and suspension I'm pretty sure
Degan Nestrichal,computer hardware // electrical // circuiting
Austin Medina,Yeah I learned a little bit about wiring and circuitry and how to troubleshoot issues in really simple circuits from here I just got to learn more complex circuitry
Degan Nestrichal,i know only theory cuz of a dumb physics class
Austin Medina,I was just learning about how to troubleshoot things like fuses switches and the actual components that use the voltage and then also how to determine which of those things could be wrong based off of using a voltmeter to conduct tests
J Cole Patt,Yeah Ive made a website before
J Cole Patt,It was in html5
J Cole Patt,I made a menu and everything kek
Degan Nestrichal,html is very different from real programming i will say
J Cole Patt,Rip
Degan Nestrichal,im saying dat cuz html isnt a programming language
J Cole Patt,I do know some functions tho
J Cole Patt,i learned java
J Cole Patt,A lil bit of it at least...
Degan Nestrichal,yeah java is a good starting point
Degan Nestrichal,python is a bad starting point
Austin Medina,Advance Auto Parts tried to hire me back on as a Parts Pro f*** that s***
Austin Medina,Also I'm using speech to text so it will blur out Every curse word
Degan Nestrichal,tell them to S ur D at gunpoint guey
J Cole Patt,Oof
Degan Nestrichal,chupa mi pene cabron
Degan Nestrichal,te voy a matar tu familia Roberto si me molestas una ves mas hablando de trabajo! Yo no quedo trabajar para un adulador!
Degan Nestrichal,*quiero but same difference
Degan Nestrichal,fk i need a haircut or else im gonna look like a NEET!
Austin Medina,niggus im sad i hit another pole im a retard
Austin Medina,you guys wanna chill this weekend i might sell my jeep and start driving my honda tho so i can only comfortably fit two people
J Cole Patt,oof
Samuel Adams,We can put Austin in the trunk and commandeer his civic
J Cole Patt,Lmao
Samuel Adams,This is ancap at its finest
J Cole Patt,Ye can chill at my place if u wanna
Austin Medina,no you can you automatic driving Neanderthal
Austin Medina,cant *
Samuel Adams,It's wishful thinking but I'm pretty sure I could operate a stick shift car
Samuel Adams,It's just parking that seems intimidating to me
Austin Medina,lmao
Austin Medina,do you know how to get it going from a complete stop
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, it's a minor process but you can get the fuckin car to jump if you don't do it right"
Austin Medina,it sounds easy
Austin Medina,but it is challenging when you first physically try
Samuel Adams,It's all in the clutch baby
Austin Medina,plus theres a lot more things you run into as you learn like slowing down properly and not taking turns going like 30 as you try to manage everything
Samuel Adams,Part of me wonders if it's even worth learning stick tho
Samuel Adams,Manuals are increasingly becoming obsolete at least in the freedom states
Austin Medina,i like sports cars so yes
Austin Medina,literally of my favorite cars are more purely enjoyed in manual
Austin Medina,"and probably my ""achievable"" dream car atm is a honda s2000 which is only available in a 6speed manual"
Austin Medina,"plus its fun to be able to rev it up and let it bounce off the limiter at your own choice, but you can do that in some automatics these days with rewarding results if they have the paddle shifters"
Samuel Adams,When we get our big rockstar bucks we'll have matching Porsche Cayman GTs and everything will be alright
Austin Medina,fucks yeah baby
Austin Medina,realistically if i had that kind of money its acura nsx or audi r8 all the way LMAO those are sick
Samuel Adams,I love NSXs
Samuel Adams,Underrated car
Austin Medina,"idk if i'd rather get an old one or newer one, theyre iconic either way"
Elijah Parker,I'd probably get a custom made car tbh.
Elijah Parker,I like smart cars but I'm way too fuckin tall for them.
Elijah Parker,That or just get a super souped up bike and move somewhere where it doesn't snow.
Austin Medina,buy a kawasaki and drive through chicago
Elijah Parker,Nah I mean an actual bike bike.
Austin Medina,remember when we were in chiraq and saw those chad guys on crotch rockets @Samuel Adams
Elijah Parker,I could slap a motor on it but motorcycles scare me far more than cars. Cars are already scary as fuck for my anxious ass.
Austin Medina,"this poggies, pretty much exactly what i would want"
Samuel Adams,Lmao I remember that shit
Samuel Adams,Chicongo is where it's at
Austin Medina,all the white girls will say yooo nice ferrari :D
Elijah Parker,"""bro is that a Jaguar bro?"""
Samuel Adams,"Omg is that a Mercedes Corvette? So cool , can I have sex with you ð¤¤"
J Cole Patt,Nah thats a ar15
Austin Medina,lol my friend tyler at work was trying to convince me to buy a vette today
Austin Medina,theres actually some decent deals on 90's and 00's models
Elijah Parker,Actually yeah I'd probably buy a Jaguar if I ever had fuck you money.
Elijah Parker,Luxurious as fuck.
Austin Medina,jaguar has some really insane performance cars and yeah also some nice luxurious cars
Austin Medina,land rover and jaguar i think are part of the same corporation or whatever so theyre pretty similar
Austin Medina,i got just the car for you bro
Austin Medina,holy fuck thats a big link
Samuel Adams,Get in the discord bb
Elijah Parker,mate I've said I can't like 16 times.
Elijah Parker,I'm not in the discord and every time I'm around JJ isn't.

J Cole Patt,Gotta be bold likey boi lenord
Elijah Parker,This looks sus as fuck
Samuel Adams,This was JJ's gf in high school but sadly she found a husband ð
Elijah Parker,Oh lmao. I thought this was just some rando and I was so confused and kind of worried.
Samuel Adams,"Yes, you must always be afraid of our intent with people Eli"
Samuel Adams,We are serial killers and we post our targets in this group chat!
Degan Nestrichal,just wok up
Degan Nestrichal,also wasup eli how long u staying up for? are u trying to stay up all night?
Degan Nestrichal,also austin teach me manual first!
Degan Nestrichal,incase i ever carjack a manual u know
Samuel Adams,I wanna FUCK you like an animal!
Elijah Parker,No thanks mate
Samuel Adams,Closer is a good song
Elijah Parker,I think it's about closing time for this lad.
Degan Nestrichal,but i wanna place an order
Degan Nestrichal,lol go to sleep yall are so fked!
Degan Nestrichal,imagine staying up instead of masturbating and then falling asleep xD

Elijah Parker,Job corps finally got back to me and said that I'm in.
Elijah Parker,So now I've just got to wait for my turn to go to campus
Austin Medina,What you gonna be doin bro
Elijah Parker,"I'm not positive just yet but I put down welding, masonry and essentially just a secretary at a doctor's office."
Samuel Adams,Let's go
Samuel Adams,Welding is big dick money if you pursue it
Elijah Parker,If I do peruse it I'm going to immediately go to college after the training for underwater welding.
Elijah Parker,This'll be me.
Elijah Parker,Mortality rate: 15% tho
Elijah Parker,But nah I mean I feel like that would be cool as fuck.
Elijah Parker,Get to see under the sea and work in it.
Austin Medina,Found out the techs at work are getting like 35 an hour thats pretty solid
Elijah Parker,That's enough to support a family on if u work full time.
Austin Medina,I mean my mom makes 20 an hour and does decent so  thats pretty much twice as much
Austin Medina,Plus you can do side work
Elijah Parker,I should say that's enough to comfortably support a family then.
Elijah Parker,But yeah plus side work on top you'd be making a fuckin mint.
Elijah Parker,me in 5 years.
Austin Medina,I wanna learn everything about cars bruh im just a nerd man
Austin Medina,Idc tho its something that inspires me
Austin Medina,"I should learn about like bmws or aston martin tho, then i can be a celebrity mechanic and work for billionaires with their expensive cars"
Samuel Adams,Dude I just had a jam session! Haha fuck corona!
Austin Medina,this is you?
Austin Medina,swag
Samuel Adams,For better or for worse
Austin Medina,playing guitar?
Samuel Adams,I don't have my Shure at home so it naturally is tin can quality
Austin Medina,or drums
Samuel Adams,"And bass, and drums"
Austin Medina,nice bro
Samuel Adams,I played with two clones of myself
Austin Medina,i like the guitar a lot
Austin Medina,obviously the bass frequencies arent coming out so well because tin can
Austin Medina,anyway since i backed my jeep into another pole if you wanna buy it eventually sam just give me 2k
Austin Medina,lol
Samuel Adams,Excellent
Austin Medina,"i got some of the dent to pop out but its still noticeable, the doors close like normal tho"
Samuel Adams,"Every time you damage your jeep, you depreciate it! I can only profit from this!"
Austin Medina,i wish i lived in arizona so i could get a rust free xj and lift it
Austin Medina,i might just have to take a trip out there and go used car shopping sometime
Austin Medina,so when we gonna go to mke and chill again boys B)
Samuel Adams,I'm down whenever
Samuel Adams,I will be returning to mke in circa 1 hour
Samuel Adams,Had quite an extended weekend but it is time to return to academia
Austin Medina,time for scholarly endeavours
Austin Medina,endeavors *
Samuel Adams,How dare you correct the Queen's English
Austin Medina,yeah just let us all know when youre gonna be good on a weekend preferably lmao
Austin Medina,i had to replace the battery in my jeep today bro that shit wouldnt start this morning so i took my moms car
Austin Medina,but it should be good going forward
Austin Medina,luckily i got a replacement for free because i had the receipt and it was under warranty
Samuel Adams,Good shit
Samuel Adams,I remember when we switched out Rande's battery lmao
Samuel Adams,Wonder how he's doing
Austin Medina,oh yeah whats rande up to nowadays
Austin Medina,yeah that shit was crazy we were out there at like 7 pm in the cold
Austin Medina,it was windy asf too
Samuel Adams,A far cry from the days we would piss off the cliff into lake michigan lmao
Samuel Adams,Summer 21 boutta be hype I guarantee it
Austin Medina,wait when did we do that
Samuel Adams,That was like August/september iirc
Austin Medina,summer 22 will be supa hype we will all be 21
Austin Medina,oh yeah thats right LMFAO
Austin Medina,i remember now
Samuel Adams,I think you me and Eddie had gone to Rande's house for the first time that day
Austin Medina,yeah i remember now and we were looking at that boat out on the lake
Austin Medina,man i wanna be a bentley tech
Austin Medina,i fuckign love bentleys theyre regal as FUCK NIGGA
Austin Medina,yeah
Austin Medina,i was planning a trip to badlands national park this summer i was thinking like late may or early june
Austin Medina,all you guys gotta do is get some camping gear and split the cost of food/water/gas and we can all go
Samuel Adams,Fuck yeah
Samuel Adams,I just gotta make sure my folks don't have any plans around that time and I'd be fresh out of school by that point
Austin Medina,"ive been doing legit research tho, its about a 12 hour straight drive we can do that in one sitting, camping we can either find free camping in the backwoods with no amenities or get a campground for some extra money, we can go hiking, exploring, visit Wall and all that"
Austin Medina,"i trust the jeep to make it out there, assuming i dont sell it to this guy at work first"
Samuel Adams,I don't wanna make any promises but if we were to postpone the trip a month it is entirely possible I will be licensed and have a car by that point kek
Samuel Adams,"That is, if it would be a factor anyway"
Austin Medina,"shit at that point we just take whoever has the bigger car, or if we wanna be a fleet just take two cars and we can pack whatever the fug we want at that point cuz we'll have hella space lmao"
Austin Medina,otherwise we can all just switch off driving and stuff to not make one person drive for 800 miles straight
Austin Medina,"but yeah i mean we can do it anytime that its warm out really, ill just take some time off work because by then ill have been there for like 6-9 months so i think theyll  be okay with me taking some time off"
Elijah Parker,Nothing wrong with being a gear head austino so long as it makes you genuinely happy.
Elijah Parker,Wait. Gear head is car guys right? Or is that grease monkey?
Elijah Parker,Or wait is it both?
Elijah Parker,Fuck.
Austin Medina,Both haga
Austin Medina,Hahah*

Samuel Adams,"Hell yeah, I can cover gas too if you need it"
Elijah Parker,Alright all we need is Eddo and J to confirm then.
Samuel Adams,"I've learned from last time, I'll make sure to pack my laptop and shit if for some strange reason I won't be able to go back that day lol"
Austin Medina,"just split it with me via facebook pay or whatever, we'll do the math after i pay"
Austin Medina,yeah lmao its always good to be prepared
Samuel Adams,Don't think there's any snow on the way doe

J Cole Patt,Ill show up tho
J Cole Patt,Ill pick up the Sam man
Elijah Parker,My room is much more spacious when it's clean dw.

J Cole Patt,ill bring weed and coke

Elijah Parker,Idc if you do it but not in front of London. I want her to have the best introduction to you guys as possible.
J Cole Patt,Str8 lines m8
Elijah Parker,Do it in the bathroom or something mate I'm serious about this one.
Austin Medina,nigga you do coke?
Elijah Parker,I mean we're already gonna be drunk but coke is a whole new ball game.
Elijah Parker,She's a stoner too though so weed b chill.
J Cole Patt,nah i dont do coke im jokin

Austin Medina,0k good lmao
J Cole Patt,The people I work for dont even distribute it. That shits got such a bad rep
Elijah Parker,I mean don't most hard drugs?
J Cole Patt,other than heroin
Elijah Parker,I mean.
J Cole Patt,"theres shit out there that doesnt seem bad,"
Elijah Parker,Heroin is still pretty bad lmao
J Cole Patt,ye
J Cole Patt,but coke people put that next to weed.
J Cole Patt,Like in canada
J Cole Patt,Coke is weed to them.
Elijah Parker,I'll stick with weed and booze meself
J Cole Patt,"Although, Booze is actually worse for you than coke."
J Cole Patt,"Although, coke is more addictive."
Elijah Parker,Yeah that's what makes it worse mate.
Elijah Parker,You've gotta keep going with it almost constantly.
J Cole Patt,"Not exactly, but p much."
Elijah Parker,Plus I mean it goes through your nose mate that already sounds terribly unhealthy.
J Cole Patt,Ye
J Cole Patt,in canada meth is also a neato thing that they like to do
Elijah Parker,Mate that's the US as well.
Elijah Parker,That and crack lmao
J Cole Patt,"like, a normal thing"
Elijah Parker,You ever been down south J?
J Cole Patt,"not in this age,"

J Cole Patt,shit tho thats wack
Elijah Parker,"Even in Winchester, TN there's a fuck ton of meta addicts."
Elijah Parker,LMAO

J Cole Patt,meta
Elijah Parker,Meta addicts are sweaty try hards on smite.
J Cole Patt,"""God damn it flordia, you were supposed to get more farm not feed!!!"""
Elijah Parker,But nah. Meth down south is like crack in kenosha.
Elijah Parker,Like half the population does it lmao
Elijah Parker,Scratch that I've got London and two other gals coming now.
Elijah Parker,So if eddo wants to come that's 8 people. 5 niggas and 3 chicks.
Samuel Adams,Hey! I wanna know!
Samuel Adams,Where do all the party people go!
Elijah Parker,My house apparently.

Elijah Parker,Oi.
Elijah Parker,Eddo.
Elijah Parker,Ur finally awake. :):)
Elijah Parker,"You wanna chill with Sam, Austin, J, my gal, two of her friends and I this Saturday at around like. 1:30 or so?"
Degan Nestrichal,"no sorry, binge drinking is more important"
Elijah Parker,That's what we were planning on doing tbh.
Elijah Parker,She's bringing fruit punch flavored JD because apparently it's super good.
Degan Nestrichal,sorry going to be occupied with binge drinking
Elijah Parker,Relatable.
Austin Medina,Eddie you gotta come bro
Samuel Adams,Eddies just scared of being drunk in front of people he doesn't know! ððð
Austin Medina,Bitch im on heroin
Degan Nestrichal,please don't plan my funeral before the body dies! trust me!
Austin Medina,Are you actually not gonna come tho
Degan Nestrichal,i have to clean my frost off of my car but its very thick
Degan Nestrichal,*the
Austin Medina,I could just pick you up to
Austin Medina,Too*
Degan Nestrichal,idk IM TERRIFIED that we are gonna hit a pole and its gonna land on my head!
Austin Medina,Who the fuck care nigga
Degan Nestrichal,that would ruin my day austin
Austin Medina,I wanna buy an fj cruiser bruh
Degan Nestrichal,"but i really gotta clean the frost off of my car, the simple brush and scraper tool i have now isnt strong enough"
Degan Nestrichal,but i dont have any fkin winter gear so staying outside for more than 10 minutes is like frostbite
Degan Nestrichal,"and id prefer to drive, i dont trust anyone else to drive except for me and God"
Samuel Adams,Gods a greedy cunt who WANTS you to die so he can repurpose your soul quicker! Bad call!
Degan Nestrichal,ok talk to me when u have a pole decapitate ur head sam! oh wait ur going to have ur day ruined by then and ur gonna be too grumpy to talk! idiot!
Degan Nestrichal,wait austin did i hear that right did u hit a pole another time?
Degan Nestrichal,cuz lmao
Degan Nestrichal,or was that the same one
Austin Medina,I hit a different pole
Austin Medina,Thats twice this month
Degan Nestrichal,lmao i was joking about the safety stuff btw but ye r u picking up sam?
Austin Medina,No j is
Degan Nestrichal,@Austin Medina's like: this is why I don't have a GF ð¡ð¡
Degan Nestrichal,sam u should do this to J on the highway unless ur a pussy lmao
Austin Medina,Lmao wtf
Samuel Adams,What is even happening here
Degan Nestrichal,gee idk sam the keys were taken out of the ignition
Austin Medina,He shouldnt have lost control tho
Austin Medina,Just put that bitch in neutral and start braking duh
Degan Nestrichal,yes austin hope u remember to do dat when ur gf takes out ur car keys on the highway
Degan Nestrichal,it most likely fucked his ability to brake or steer and he had to swerve
Degan Nestrichal,pretty sure removing ur keys would lock ur steering wheel and fuck ur brakes
Austin Medina,Lmao ok
Samuel Adams,On a newer car maybe
Samuel Adams,This is the problem of every component becoming digitized
Samuel Adams,The car ONLY works if it's running lmao
Austin Medina,"It doesnt affect ur brakes at all, or it shouldnt at least, thats all mechanical and works through hydraulic fluid"
Samuel Adams,And I mean as far as steering goes wouldn't it just turn off your power steering
Samuel Adams,Buddy's also got a manual so he was still able to shift
Degan Nestrichal,ur power brakes
Degan Nestrichal,"and it would for sure lock ur steering wheel, it does this on my car"
Austin Medina,You cant take the key out of ignition in most cars unless ur in park im pretty sure
Austin Medina,But that was a manual car anyway so the steering wheel wouldnt lock
Degan Nestrichal,this is shit hole 3rd world country austin anything can happen!
Austin Medina,Oh yeah theyre speaking spanish
Degan Nestrichal,ur a disgrace to the latinx community austin!
Samuel Adams,"Nah he's right I had a beater in my driveway for the longest time and even after jumping it, you couldn't take the key out of the ignition if it was in neutral"
Degan Nestrichal,well idk we saw it happen
Degan Nestrichal,so XD
Samuel Adams,I remember that was actually a problem because that was how we towed it out of the driveway but you had to keep a foot on the brakes at all times if you're jumping it to even get enough power to shift it back to park lmao
Samuel Adams,"But since it was parked, the parking brake was on and it wasn't going anywhere, it was a headache as I recall because the car literally couldn't hold a charge"
Austin Medina,Hes a shit driver then
Austin Medina,You would lose the brake booster bc no engine vacuum but you could still brake
Austin Medina,"Slowly pull up on parking brake too, if you yank it itd probably make u skid tho"
Degan Nestrichal,austin u teaching me how to drive manny?
Austin Medina,But yeah im pretty sure in most automatic cars if you turn the ignition to the off position while its in anything but park it wont let the key out
Austin Medina,Fuck no
Degan Nestrichal,y not :(
Austin Medina,Im not even good yet
Samuel Adams,Yall gotta hit up my dad and take his ford focus out for manual practice!
Degan Nestrichal,i just wanna know the basics lmao
Degan Nestrichal,austin is there any real benefit to this manny transmission other than looking cool on the internet?
Degan Nestrichal,"cuz if so then idc, i just wanna look cool on the internet!"
Samuel Adams,Ability to drive pretty much anything and more control over the vehicle
J Cole Patt,rip
Degan Nestrichal,dont answer that question austin i know ur gonna give me an entire MLA 12pt font times new roman essay due at 11:59PM
J Cole Patt,ay im not gonna go to le party
J Cole Patt,shit seems like 2 many people
Samuel Adams,The typical way of driving stick where you shift within power bands gives you maximum performance and is basically analogous to how an automatic shifts
Samuel Adams,However my dad usually shifts to 5th as soon as possible because it's better gas mileage
Austin Medina,Manual lets u shift when you hit 7k rpm so your honda racing lawnmower sounds sick asf
Degan Nestrichal,honestly what do u guys even plan to do lmao if theres like 8 ppl in elis lil room
Austin Medina,We should go somewhere else bru
Austin Medina,Like eddies place ð
Samuel Adams,"There is also another room down the hall I should note, if we're going to Eli's"
Samuel Adams,@Elijah Parker
Degan Nestrichal,lol this is how none of u limp dick faggots care about linux despite the fact that it has a monolithic kernel and doesnt have bloated updates that slow down older hardware!
Austin Medina,Ah shit
Austin Medina,I accidentally reacted my own message
Degan Nestrichal,was that the MLA essay i didnt even see
Austin Medina,Manual good for some things automatic good for some things
Austin Medina,I like manual cuz it feels more fun to drive and driving experience is big for me
Degan Nestrichal,ah so its ok if i use an automatic transmission to go to the amazon store and purchase my lunch got it
Austin Medina,Yep
Austin Medina,Automatic even nowadays is better for performance models
Samuel Adams,Lmao Eddie don't you remember we had like 7 people in the room when Eli's siblings came over
Samuel Adams,I just remembered that
Degan Nestrichal,o ya
J Cole Patt,i wouldnt mind havin a nigga or two over.
Austin Medina,Because modern trans shifts faster than people ever could
Degan Nestrichal,no J if u want alcohol u have to come to alcohol ð¡
Degan Nestrichal,does that mean austin is picking up sem
Samuel Adams,The day we split our social gatherings is the day our friend group ceases to exist! The end times are here!
J Cole Patt,i do not want alchohol
Austin Medina,Ill pick up sem if needed
Degan Nestrichal,i think i remember him saying that he would perform 98 hours of intense manual labor a week for the rest of his life if it meant that he had a 0.00002% chance of having a big tit goth gf kiss his dick and subsequently throw up! its called the aiden moore sex position!
Samuel Adams,This is probably true
Austin Medina,98 hours of intense manual labor bro you would be shredded
Degan Nestrichal,austin r u gonna drink or no
Austin Medina,A lil bit
Elijah Parker,Texas roadhouse is a fucking tragedy.
Austin Medina,Wym
Elijah Parker,Bro the peanuts mate.
Elijah Parker,It's like walking into a fuckin barn full of peanuts.
Elijah Parker,Alright so who's all coming saturday then?
Elijah Parker,So I know how many chairs I need.
Samuel Adams,"I assume it's gonna at least be me, you, Eddie, and Austin with London and the other two gals if J's not coming"
Elijah Parker,Alright. J you're not coming then?
J Cole Patt,"ye man, I believe that its too many people."
J Cole Patt,"Like shit, 7 people not including me"
J Cole Patt,Plus 3 strangers.
J Cole Patt,Im gucci
Elijah Parker,I mean if that's what you feel fair enough. We've done it before with no issues but I understand
J Cole Patt,8 people?
Elijah Parker,Yeah.
J Cole Patt,rip
Elijah Parker,It's not that crazy mate all I've gotta do is get more chairs from downstairs.
J Cole Patt,Nah but i dont trust the strangers.
Samuel Adams,And like I said if it was really crowded we've got another room down the hall lmao
Elijah Parker,I understand mate I'm not saying you have to come.

Samuel Adams,I should also emphasize that you guys don't need me there to hang out kek
Elijah Parker,That's true but everyone likes sammy.
Austin Medina,Were fucking picking you up im sure my jeep will make it
Elijah Parker,ð
Samuel Adams,Alright bruv just don't have your car die on you in the middle of the highway ð

Austin Medina,"We should get food saturday too, im tryna get big so i been eating more"
Elijah Parker,I feel.

Austin Medina,Split a mortgage nikka how would that work
Austin Medina,Like when its all said and done whose name is it in
Elijah Parker,I hab no monies. :(:(
Samuel Adams,How many names can you put on a deed anyway
Samuel Adams,I mean shit if a bank can own a house why can't 5 or 6 losers do it
Elijah Parker,That's true.
Austin Medina,We could also just rent a house for a while and all room together gotta line up legit jobs first tho
Degan Nestrichal,only legit job in the US is software engineer everything else is dishonest werk
Samuel Adams,We can all work at Eddie's software firm
Samuel Adams,Which is run out of the same property which means we kill two birds with one stone it's a perfect plan
Degan Nestrichal,lol u limp dick faggots wish you could program in java and c
Austin Medina,"Im gonna start training for lube tech soon, i shadowed one of the apprentices today for a while learning about the inspections we do"
Elijah Parker,I mean once I get out of job Corps (more than likely for welding) I'm going to be getting a job in it while learning underwater welding at the same time.
Austin Medina,Welding is dank
Elijah Parker,Underwater welding sounds fantastic too. I get to be a diver and also a welder at the same time.
Austin Medina,"Id like to open my own business someday, gotta learn a lot about the legal and bookkeeping side of things tho"
Elijah Parker,What kinda business lad?
Austin Medina,"Auto repair shop, but i gotta get a lot of experience first and lump sum for expenses"
Elijah Parker,Sounds nice lad. Being able to do the thing you like for a living.
Austin Medina,I suppose i could start small tho and do work on peoples cars depending on what it is
Degan Nestrichal,austin just likes dinero & cars so y not do both xD
Austin Medina,"If its just brakes, suspension, exhaust, stuff like that"
Austin Medina,I can do that
Austin Medina,But i dont have the equipment for like diagnosing electrical or engine issues
Degan Nestrichal,sam learn java from doing stuff in minecraft
Degan Nestrichal,with the server you'll be devOps in 2 weeks
Degan Nestrichal,now that i have a minecraft server and extensive knowledge about java i am gonna make a modpack
Elijah Parker,Make it so cats are invincible. :):)
Degan Nestrichal,only thing thats gonna be invincible is penis-kun
Degan Nestrichal,cats can burn in hell
J Cole Patt,cat meat
J Cole Patt,ðð
Austin Medina,Negus
Elijah Parker,Fuck you
Elijah Parker,ur a real ass bud.
Degan Nestrichal,i like how eli is the only one between u guys w/o a cat and he is the one defending them
Austin Medina,Real cat owners know theyre assholes
Elijah Parker,I've owned numerous cats.
Elijah Parker,And hang out with strays all the time.
Elijah Parker,Cats are sweethearts if you know how to read what they want.
Degan Nestrichal,cats are stupid they cant even speak english
Austin Medina,Im talking about when they come in your room at 3 am and start plucking at the strings on ur guitar
Austin Medina,Yes that rly happens he knows how to play guitar better than eddie
Elijah Parker,Bro my cat would come into my room at 3 AM and jump on my chest because she wanted to play.
Elijah Parker,But I still loved her to bits and wouldn't trade her for the world.
Austin Medina,I like my cat too hes just annoying at night
Degan Nestrichal,thts cap cat doesnt even know pentatonic scale
Degan Nestrichal,god austin why do u always have to put me down its not my fault god put all my traits in handsomeness and cock size!
J Cole Patt,Ive lived with cats b4
J Cole Patt,7 of em
Elijah Parker,Sounds like heaven mate.
J Cole Patt,How i treated em
Elijah Parker,All you've gotta do is understand their body language and respect it and they'll be just as sweet as a dog. They just like to be left alone sometimes as opposed to a dog go which is always like that.
Elijah Parker,Also
Elijah Parker,Fuck you cunt.
J Cole Patt,Ya YEET
Elijah Parker,>:^(>:^(>:^(>:^(
Elijah Parker,Non that's fuze with the hostage.
Degan Nestrichal,u just mad that J could take on 100 malnourished NYC strat cats
Degan Nestrichal,understandable tho not everyone born with that gift
Elijah Parker,I sincerely doubt that actually.
Elijah Parker,In fact I'd love to see anyone try and fist fight 100 cats.
Elijah Parker,Them mfs go for the eyes and the throat if it's something bigger than them.
J Cole Patt,Id fuck em up
Elijah Parker,Alright so basically what we've gotta do is get 100 starving stray cats and throw j in with them.
Elijah Parker,No weapons. Just your hands.
Austin Medina,My buddy put a new exhaust on his evo its noice
J Cole Patt,My usual street clothes.
J Cole Patt,A pocket knife but honestly i wouldnt use that
Elijah Parker,No.
Elijah Parker,Nothing.
J Cole Patt,Man imma grab them by they head and str8 slam
J Cole Patt,Usual street clothes
Elijah Parker,Cats don't get weapons and they're starving.
J Cole Patt,Rip them right
J Cole Patt,Nah i can use bare hands
Elijah Parker,That's the thing you don't get though mate. 100 of them.
J Cole Patt,Finna snap sum necks.
Elijah Parker,You can grab one? Maybe two at a time?
Austin Medina,Need me one of these ð
J Cole Patt,Or drop kick a bunch
J Cole Patt,Go get 100 od em
J Cole Patt,Imma go haaam
Elijah Parker,Whatcha gonna do about the other 98 of them while you've got the two in your hands?
J Cole Patt,Kill them too
Elijah Parker,They're going to be on your ass clawing the shit out of your eyes and throat. Like it or not J you're not Superman.
Elijah Parker,I'd really like to see someone fight a hippo though.
Elijah Parker,"Hippos are literally like living weapons bro. They weigh over a ton, can run up to 19 miles an hour in short bursts and those tusks are essentially swords with a fuck ton of pressure from that jaw closing on you."
Elijah Parker,They're so unpredictable as well.
J Cole Patt,Nah man imma kill 100 cats
J Cole Patt,Just to prove a point
Elijah Parker,They'll go from chillin to straight killing your ass in half a second.
J Cole Patt,Go get em then
J Cole Patt,Well see
Elijah Parker,You kill a single cat I'm not talking to you again.
J Cole Patt,Suprisingly i have not killed a cat in my lifetime
Elijah Parker,That's probably why you think you can take them.
J Cole Patt,Ive fought cats before
J Cole Patt,They ez
J Cole Patt,U can crush their skulls
J Cole Patt,Fairly ez
Elijah Parker,I could crush yours fairly easy too.
J Cole Patt,Yeah cuz ur a fatass you could break a chair
J Cole Patt,Rip
J Cole Patt,Just trollin u tho
Elijah Parker,I weigh less than you now nigga fuck you mean
Austin Medina,bruh tf yall talkin about
J Cole Patt,"Shit u right, then how u gonna break a skull when ur anorexic af"
J Cole Patt,I have no clue
J Cole Patt,Cats ig
J Cole Patt,Baiting him to get mad cuz its funny
Elijah Parker,It's ez to do when you're not conscious.
Elijah Parker,and even the hardest headed nigga on earth can get his shit broken with enough stomps.
J Cole Patt,Relax eli im fucking w u
J Cole Patt,Unless u crimson chin
J Cole Patt,This also account for cats as well =^)
Elijah Parker,Lmfao I know I'm fucking with you too mate.
Elijah Parker,You own cats why would you want to kill one?
J Cole Patt,They cunts
Elijah Parker,Nah but realistically if you know their body language and such they're just as sweet as dogs they just like their personal space.
J Cole Patt,I know some dickish cats but thats just cuz their owners are rich
Elijah Parker,True. Like if you take the time to get to know them and don't fuck with them when they want to  be alone they're the best.
Elijah Parker,Also. You decide if you're coming tomorrow or not?
J Cole Patt,Will u b buying weed?
J Cole Patt,I am more than likely transporting cargo n such
Elijah Parker,I mean I can't speak for  everyone but probably not.
Degan Nestrichal,"lmao taking out 100 NYC stray cats is easy, just put out a bowl of catnip in an alley then throw a pipebomb once they gather"
Degan Nestrichal,use ur fucking brain!!
Elijah Parker,That's the issue with it. No weapons.
Elijah Parker,Since they're already starving and don't have weapons themselves besides what they evolved with.
Degan Nestrichal,"gain their trust and put out some catnip, then snap all of their necks fast"
Degan Nestrichal,i could easily do that
J Cole Patt,Like scp 173
Degan Nestrichal,i could at least take on 250
Degan Nestrichal,them cats b stupid
Elijah Parker,Alright.
J Cole Patt,Man just throw 1000 at me
Elijah Parker,Since you guys are such big dick chads why not just make it a single lion?
Degan Nestrichal,"full grown lion is impossible they are strong as fk, need to game them somehow"
J Cole Patt,From what ve heard its possible
Elijah Parker,100 cats together is like 5 lions but worse since they have the numbers.
Degan Nestrichal,nah more like 0.25 lions
Degan Nestrichal,them cats are stupid and non-predatory
Elijah Parker,Have you ever even seen a cat bro
Degan Nestrichal,bro cats will not lunge at you and chase you down
Degan Nestrichal,unprovoked
Degan Nestrichal,lions will
Elijah Parker,cats are more predatory than lions sometimes. they'll kill just for the fun of it.
Elijah Parker,You guys are also thinking of this as one cat and not a literal hundred.
Degan Nestrichal,"well im telling u, its not like 100 cats are going to be actively trying to kill you they are just gonna be chilling to u provoke them"
Degan Nestrichal,*til
Degan Nestrichal,a lion tho is gonna hunt u down
Degan Nestrichal,eli ur really telling me u think 4 lions would be less difficult than 100 malnourished cats?
Elijah Parker,Yes but I'm not saying they will. I'm saying once you kill one of them they're gonna be on ur shit.
Elijah Parker,I'm saying they're both extremely dangerous.
Elijah Parker,A lion has mass over a house cat yes.
Degan Nestrichal,but they can only really stratch and bite
Degan Nestrichal,lions will maul u alive
Elijah Parker,But they go for your eyes and throat nigga.
Degan Nestrichal,1 lion is at LEAST 400 cats
Elijah Parker,That's gonna kill you just the same.
Samuel Adams,Dude in other news CJ is TikTok famous! Holy shit!
Degan Nestrichal,no fucking way!
Elijah Parker,Carl Johnson?
Degan Nestrichal,cant find the account @Samuel Adams what is it

Degan Nestrichal,lmao she gonna get a minecraft tattoo
Degan Nestrichal,steve tattoo goes fucking hard!
Degan Nestrichal,o btw join the gay but only if willing to accept the truth that 400 cats = 1 lion in a weaponless battle
Degan Nestrichal,@Elijah Parker in the winter it would be even easier because extra padding on clothes AND they are gonna be shivering and nearly dead anyways!
Elijah Parker,Okay I'm done with this conversation mate.
Elijah Parker,Think what you will.
Degan Nestrichal,i am a free thinker

JJ Joseph,I rather eat my ketchup shoe leather
Samuel Adams,It's been over a year since Eddie demolished Drake Fox :(
JJ Joseph,Or since drake destroyed Eddie by threatening legal force that could have disproportionately hurt Eddie in many ways
JJ Joseph,Because of a reddit post
JJ Joseph,@Eddie Chavez  I'm glad we aren't talking to drake that was out of line and possibly racially motivated
Samuel Adams,Well it's certainly not out of the question as far as drake is concerned
J Cole Patt,The dictator drake fox has been destroyed by our general Eddie Chavez
JJ Joseph,Drake would go to court over a tiny scratch in his cars paint
Degan Nestrichal,all i got was a funny phonecall out of that ordeal
Samuel Adams,"Little does Drake know, this guy gave his life to save his son from drowning in a riptide"
JJ Joseph,Drake when were talking about le firering arm hehe look I got my fal and some mags in Rhodesian colors hehehe rhodesia forever *shows me his Rhodesian flag
Samuel Adams,Drake the kind of guy to point out of the merits of the Belgian Congo

Elijah Parker,I feel like we should probably try to call him or something.
Samuel Adams,Austin is active on FB which means he is clearly avoiding looking at the group chat duh
Elijah Parker,Unless someone just tried to call him. I think Facebook shows you as active when people call.

Samuel Adams,I haven't really gotten proper sleep yet and I've been waking up like on the hour but it was fuckin great
Austin Medina,bro that girl threw up on my dick it was nutty
Austin Medina,"fug bro honestly man, after heavily contemplating the futility of man and reading nihilistic texts by Nietzsche, subsequently pondering on existentialist theory I've realized that I dont wanna make money anymore bro it has no intrinsic value, drugs are way more instrinically valuable"
Austin Medina,As I sit here and ponder and whether or not I have been a good ally to black people all these years. It's time we stop using the nigger word guys
Samuel Adams,Ahh!
Austin Medina,"P > V, ur holy. Penis to penis, you will be claimed by satanis"
J Cole Patt,Who are you austin
J Cole Patt,Using such swear words are important
J Cole Patt,"Today i will either make money, or be in jail."

Myjuanron Taylor,"Ayy that's good, it's been a little rough, and I'm still unemployed but that's that"
Elijah Parker,Have you checked out job corps lad? They'll train you for a trade totally free of cost.
Myjuanron Taylor,"I've applied to Jewels, probs gonna apply to Dollar gen in a bit"
Elijah Parker,Good shit bro. I'm glad you're not letting it get you down at least homie.
Myjuanron Taylor,"Can't let it, gotta just push past it"
Elijah Parker,Shit true but I mean I'm glad either way you aren't. It's good to see you're not letting it fuck with you homie ð
Myjuanron Taylor,Thanks man

Austin Medina,I might redownload minecraft
Samuel Adams,We're getting off to a stellar start on GAY
Elijah Parker,Sammy do you happen to have a cigar box around your house?
Samuel Adams,Unfortunately not
Elijah Parker,Fuk
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna do some research and once I get some extra cash from Marquette I might even order some shit for this project
Elijah Parker,Ah mate it's not gonna need a whole bunch.
Samuel Adams,I'm aware but the beauty of a cigar box guitar is getting a lot out of a few components
Samuel Adams,It's probably in our best interest to have backup shit because I imagine it'll be easy to fuck up lol
Samuel Adams,Holy fuck! Redpilled MC server!
Degan Nestrichal,rebecca is trembling at how to out redpill us as we speak!
Degan Nestrichal,cigar box guitar?
Samuel Adams,Basically we build our own guitar out of stuff you can generally find lying around
Degan Nestrichal,that reminds of this one video i saw of this madison student making a guitar out of nothing
Samuel Adams,"If the first one is cool and works out, we wanna make more"
Degan Nestrichal,who is we
Samuel Adams,Me and Eli
Degan Nestrichal,o i c
Samuel Adams,Best case scenario is I can record songs with it and it won't sound like shit xd
Degan Nestrichal,"thats interesting actually, im not a very good craftsman so it seems mountainous"
Elijah Parker,Me either but grandpa has been working with wood for over 40 years so if we get stuck I'm sure he wouldn't mind helping.
Austin Medina,I know how to work wood too
Austin Medina,;]
Degan Nestrichal,funny u say this at the same exact time
Samuel Adams,This is our foray into being luthiers boys
Austin Medina,Why dont we just start a youtube channel or all start streaming
Austin Medina,And make vlogs out of our degenerate fuckery or irl stream
Degan Nestrichal,because ur computer is on its dying breath!
Austin Medina,Thats inconsequential bro
Austin Medina,!!
Samuel Adams,Austin sell your laptop to Eli
Degan Nestrichal,lol once covid is over we can do funner shit
Austin Medina,Im excited for life to eventually get back to normal
Samuel Adams,Fuck man it can't come soon enough honestly lol
Austin Medina,Supposedly most americans should be fully vaxxed by end of july
Degan Nestrichal,is herd immunity like 90%
Samuel Adams,Apparently they pushed summerfest back to september again
Austin Medina,"Idek, but theres bound to be some folk that dont get vaccinated idek how thatll play out"
Samuel Adams,We gotta go see some shows boys if they don't fuckin cancel it
Austin Medina,Hell yeah bro
Samuel Adams,Ultimate end-goal is to play shows of course owo
Austin Medina,Ill keep practicing
Elijah Parker,I'll be the guy with a cigar box guitar.
Elijah Parker,Or perhaps.
Elijah Parker,a BASS
Samuel Adams,Acoustic basses are kinda lackluster imo
Samuel Adams,Almost like bass is meant to be an electric instrument
Elijah Parker,Thanks for remembering I don't want to make the cigar box guitar electric bb ððð
Elijah Parker,In other news.
Elijah Parker,It's fucking cold.
Samuel Adams,"Personally I think an acoustic electric would be fantastic, you can play it unplugged and then if it's got a pickup you can plug it in and probably get some nice ass tones from it"
Elijah Parker,I was out on a walk to get some schmonk and cuddled this stray cat I know. Poor baby was shivering like a mf with his short coat havin ass. I slipped him under my coat and cuddled him for a few minutes so he could warm up. I really wish I could have a cat. I call him Mr. Meowstache because he's a tuxedo with a pattern above his mouth that looks spot on like the monopoly man's moustache.
Elijah Parker,Eh I'd probably make the first one just acoustic. I like acoustic better personally. Although with how cheap it'll be to make we can make numerous sammy.
Elijah Parker,We could make a cigar box banjo and create a bluegrass band too sammy boy
Elijah Parker,My lock screen is now London and I. It will be a different picture in a bit but the same category. We're gonna hang out again ððð
Samuel Adams,Excellent
Samuel Adams,"I'm looking into the engineering behind these things, thankfully we can get most of the wood we need from Lowe's or whatever"
Elijah Parker,Grandpa has a shit load of wood downstairs bro
Elijah Parker,He makes bows and such with it.
Samuel Adams,"The most important things are going to be proper intonation and fret spacing, once we actually build a structurally sound piece"
Elijah Parker,That's where it'll be up to you and me.
Elijah Parker,And that's also where the youtube videos come in lmfao
Elijah Parker,Like he'll do some of that I imagine but that'll be a whole new ball game for him
Samuel Adams,That's why I'm watching a lot of videos on this particular part of it lol
Elijah Parker,When I asked him about it he told me he's never built a guitar actually.
Elijah Parker,Do you also have strings I can use?
Samuel Adams,"Buying strings won't be an issue, we can probably just use general guitar strings on this thing"
Samuel Adams,"My idea is to string it up basically like a normal guitar but with 4 strings, EADG"
Elijah Parker,What's EADG?
Elijah Parker,LMFAO
Elijah Parker,never mind bro I've been skoking
Samuel Adams,Those are the corresponding notes for each string generally
Elijah Parker,smoking***
Austin Medina,I just had the most mind-numbing conversation with that chick at work
Elijah Parker,Do those sound good for like the blues and jazz as well as they do for rock though?
Austin Medina,She tried to convince me that Jews are white
Samuel Adams,"However I like to tune my 4 string acoustic to open tunings and I've written quite a few songs with these, like DADGb or DGDG"
J Cole Patt,eddie ate dynamite!
J Cole Patt,good bye eddie!!
Samuel Adams,One thing I should mention is that we don't have to think about genre when we're building this thing
Samuel Adams,"It'll sound perfectly fine for whatever you play on it, intervals don't change, but instrument timbre does"
Elijah Parker,Alright cool. I'm just personally like. way more interested in learning those genres yk?
Elijah Parker,I've been watching tutorials but without something to practice on it just feels like a waste of time rn
Samuel Adams,Tutorials on how to build the instrument or how to play it? Kek
J Cole Patt,Shit the biggest tbing i hate about learning a instrument is not wanting to play cause of lack of practice.
Elijah Parker,Play it lol
Elijah Parker,I suppose I should start watching the building ones first though eh?
Samuel Adams,"Honestly I don't know, I'm coming at this with a decent background in music so I understand the theory and some of the engineering like using harmonics to find where to put the frets"
Samuel Adams,But I think for our purposes we should focus on building the highest quality instrument possible first and then when it's functional we can think about learning how to play it
Austin Medina,We're about to get so much fuking snow I hate this state
Austin Medina,Also what the hell Vincent Jackson died
Austin Medina,Sem u know who that is or nah
Samuel Adams,Old WR for the Bucs

Degan Nestrichal,here is a good video outlining the different crypto wallets.
Degan Nestrichal,electrum and wasabi are closer to the original crypto philosophy of decentralization
Degan Nestrichal,"the channel is pretty dope, guy is a network engineer that teaches stuff about operations security and cryptography"
Samuel Adams,Eli is definitely blackout drunk right now

Samuel Adams,I can't think of anyone who would be filling in for Drake around this time
Samuel Adams,Truth be told I didn't really keep in touch with any of the st joes drummers after we went our separate ways
Samuel Adams,I could probably still find timmy taco on campus and ask if he wants to jam xd
Samuel Adams,Just talked to Audino about snow drifting and was reminded that we could've nearly died on the mf highway on the way to Kenosha lmao
Degan Nestrichal,noooo then we woulda never hit it off with those grills ð

Austin Medina,Cant wait till all the atheistic satanists start teaching children
Degan Nestrichal,thats right austin if you are like every single guy and judge a girl on physical appearance u have shrimp dick energy!
JJ Joseph,"Fun fact this article is wrong transgender people have been competing with there new gender but not in all places. One major story they tend to use as evidence was when a ""trans women"" who look like a man beat all the girl wrestlers, well that person was actually a trans man. Trans men preform at a similar level as cis men. This also goes to transgender woman as well the statement is unfounded that trans women out preform cis women because almost everywhere they already don't let trans women play until there ""passing"" this means they have gone through hormone therapy. Also it's funny to mention Caitlyn jenner who stoped takeing hormone replacement when she got into her relationship with kris jenner in 1991"
JJ Joseph,They have been since the 90s
JJ Joseph,Probably before that too
Samuel Adams,I used my ult on that last bitch! She's now dead!

Samuel Adams,How was your time with le London
Elijah Parker,Slippin and sliding all over the place but still trying to look tough the whole time lmfao.
Elijah Parker,I'm still here actually. We're about to be taking off p soon but she's doing an assignment right now
Samuel Adams,Pog
Elijah Parker,There's a ton of people who go to campus here.
J Cole Patt,The security guards there are dicks
Samuel Adams,What's the policy ther
Samuel Adams,Are they allowing outsiders into the buildings or nah?
Elijah Parker,Northern Ireland is not Britain lad ask any North Irishman and they'll slap you for even thinking it.
Samuel Adams,@JJ Joseph
Elijah Parker,Nah she snuck me in. No overnight visitors.
Samuel Adams,"I figured as much, that's the policy here too except no visitors at all"
Elijah Parker,I had to pee last night so she gave me some of her carthage merch to blend in and keep.
Samuel Adams,The perks of living in a dorm with an en suite bathroom in every room

Austin Medina,"I was considering getting a lexus bro lmao, i found some nice ones theyre basically just luxury toyotas"

Austin Medina,I was considering getting one but i want a comfy car eventually
Samuel Adams,Austin what site do you mostly use for car shopping
Austin Medina,Cars.com and facebook marketplace
Samuel Adams,How the fuck does this thing only have 33k miles lmao
Samuel Adams,This man drove his car 2 miles a day
Austin Medina,You can look up features you want like heated seats
Samuel Adams,If this winter has taught me anything it's that I'd like a 4x4 car as long as I live where it can drop a foot of snow overnight lmao
Austin Medina,4x4 is good for getting unstuck and stuff but you still gotta leave a lot of stopping space
Samuel Adams,"Honestly once I get a good bit familiar with the Escape, I'll probably understand moreso what to really look for in a car"
Austin Medina,"Just get something with decent heat, awd or 4x4, decent sound system, you should be good with that for a starter car fasho brotha"
Samuel Adams,Yee
Samuel Adams,"This escape has 91k miles on it, I'd consider fixing some of the stuff on it like the front right speaker that's semi-blown out but I should probably look to get rid of it within the first year or two"
Samuel Adams,It's probably not worth much more than 2k sadly
Austin Medina,What year is it
Samuel Adams,2008
Austin Medina,"Nah thats worth more im willing to bet, just fix it up and clean it real good when you go to sell"
Austin Medina,Ill do work on it if u want bro i gotta practice ð³ cheap ass oil changes for all my friends
Samuel Adams,My only worry is the repairs will cost more than I can get for it lol
Samuel Adams,"Both bumpers are damaged a little and the right rear tail light is basically colored duct tape, and I dunno where to start with redoing the speakers since if I gotta replace one I might as well do them all"
Austin Medina,"Depends man, if its big work it could be, but brakes, suspension, stuff like that is usually worth doing"
Austin Medina,Youtube it
Austin Medina,I kinda wanna come check it out and see if anything is wrong from what i can tell
Samuel Adams,There's also some sort of leak somewhere which trips a code but my dad has a doohickey that clears the check engine light and it's certainly not anything that makes it undrivable or unsafe
Austin Medina,Probably exhaust or evap or some shit
Austin Medina,I wanna get a tattoo bruh
Austin Medina,Gonna get a tat of Arminius on my bicep
Elijah Parker,Artimus?
Austin Medina,No
Austin Medina,Arminius
J Cole Patt,I can get u a real nice tattoo artist.
Austin Medina,He was an ancient german hero and chieftain
Austin Medina,He was taken by the romans and raised as a roman and trained in warfare and then sent back to germany to help the roman effort to civilize and take over the region but he returned to his people and decimated a bunch of romans in the teutoberg forest
Samuel Adams,Austin's master plan is to masquerade as a liberal and then decimate them in the upcoming civil war! Watch out!
Austin Medina,ð¤£
Austin Medina,I like the story and idea of not betraying ur family
J Cole Patt,kek
J Cole Patt,Betrayal is the worst thing to do.
Elijah Parker,non
Samuel Adams,"For a fuckton of money, this old ass rust bucket can be yours!"
Austin Medina,Lmao that shit better be turboed with full suspension for that price
J Cole Patt,lol
J Cole Patt,woot
Samuel Adams,"The world will end on January 19th, 2038 at 9:14 PM CST!"
Samuel Adams,Eddie knows why
Elijah Parker,Just another y2k mate
Samuel Adams,Started trying to learn Sails of Charon for real
Samuel Adams,What a fucking insane technique Uli has
Samuel Adams,I think I'll stay contentedly in my rudy schenker lane lmao
Austin Medina,Is not too hard
Austin Medina,I am beginning my training for a Lube Tech job today
Samuel Adams,Excellent
Samuel Adams,I have a mandatory covid test in about an hour
Samuel Adams,I have suddenly developed an appreciation for Def Leppard despite hating most of their material for most of my life
Samuel Adams,"It's meant to be poppy rock of course, but on top of that it's brilliantly produced"
Austin Medina,Never really listened to them all too much
Austin Medina,And this is in a Buick
Elijah Parker,London just left :(:(
Elijah Parker,She spent the night at my house this time though lol
Samuel Adams,Y'all are logging some serious hours with each other
Elijah Parker,Yeah man. Pretty much the only time we've been apart since saturday was when she's had class.
Austin Medina,Sam you should be a porter in the summer once you learn to drive its hella ez
Austin Medina,Im getting paid to drive around rn
Austin Medina,And listen to blue oyster cult
Elijah Parker,That sounds p fun.
Samuel Adams,I'm probably shooting myself in the foot by not looking into internships
Samuel Adams,I gotta have something to do this summer
Austin Medina,Fuk them internships
Austin Medina,I should be a full time lubetech by summer thatll be fun
JJ Joseph,Well if depends on if you want to stay on the path your on and your school would have a department to help with employment and internships
Samuel Adams,I want to drop out and become a full time musician and drunk philosopher what's the game plan for that
JJ Joseph,You could join the mm
Samuel Adams,I think if college doesn't work out I'll just join the military and needlessly die in a crossfire because we deemed it necessary to have access to a marginal amount of resources barely beyond the American sphere of influence
JJ Joseph,Try the mm first get some time at sea then if you really want I think you get some bonus points from the navy
Samuel Adams,I don't think I inherited the navy gene from either of my parents
Samuel Adams,I can barely swim and the open sea is freaky
Samuel Adams,And my eyesight is far too poor to do anything cool in the air force rip
Austin Medina,Just be a chad
Austin Medina,Dumazz
JJ Joseph,Ok bud ya I'm gonna make myself ship my ass to the south and west to join the army or marines
JJ Joseph,You could just go with for a few miles and boom your in basic
Austin Medina,I had to go drop a car off to a guy because he has an Audi S6 at the dealership and they're working on making it about 800 horsepower
Samuel Adams,My major is chinese exchange student
Elijah Parker,Did me taxes lads
Elijah Parker,Hopped up on turbotax lmao
Austin Medina,Im getting quite a bit cuz i didnt get any stimulus
Elijah Parker,Me either.
Elijah Parker,So I hope I'm getting a lot too.
Austin Medina,It didnt give you an estimate?
Elijah Parker,I didn't check.
Elijah Parker,I like to be surprised lol
Samuel Adams,This man gonna end up owing tens of thousands in back taxes
Austin Medina,We should all chill with sam one day when markwet opens again
Elijah Parker,"I'm gonna give a ton to my grandparents, get something nice for London but save it for until we're together for a while, have some set aside for smonk until they tell me I can go to campus in Milwaukee and save the rest."
Elijah Parker,Job Corps will be paying me 500 when I complete my training on top of the money they're giving me for like deodorant and soap and toothpaste and shit.
Elijah Parker,Should be litty kitty.
Degan Nestrichal,lets see what happens..

Degan Nestrichal,i knew austin wouldnt know that so i told him specifically
Elijah Parker,That's fucked
Austin Medina,Thanks for the heads up
Austin Medina,Im just retardee
Austin Medina,Retarded
Austin Medina,ð
Degan Nestrichal,but ye the point was that i posted that on r/unexpected on reddit with the account AustimoMeBEANER
Elijah Parker,It would work better as beana. It would sound more like his name ans you could say the a is just a funny way to have the r.
Degan Nestrichal,ok this time it has the NSFW flag so it should be good
Degan Nestrichal,ah nvm
Degan Nestrichal,god reddit mods are such nolifes
Elijah Parker,Lmao fucked.
Degan Nestrichal,off to r/cringetopia i go!
Elijah Parker,Post it on a shit fetish subreddit so we can laugh at the responses calling it hot
Elijah Parker,I'm full of good ideas eddo stick around.
Degan Nestrichal,i did get 1 reddit mod so thats good
Degan Nestrichal,another reddit mod is gonna bite the dust i suppose
Degan Nestrichal,lets see how this does on r/hiphop
Degan Nestrichal,a mod removed it lmao
Degan Nestrichal,it was on there for a good minute
Degan Nestrichal,o nvm it was a formatting issue
Degan Nestrichal,fuck my car has been vandalized by nature
Austin Medina,Lmao rip
Samuel Adams,Rush Limbaugh died
Samuel Adams,Rest in piss is now trending on twitter lmao
Elijah Parker,Whomst?
Elijah Parker,Like what is he known for? I recognize the name.
Samuel Adams,He was a conservative talk host
Elijah Parker,Covid?
Samuel Adams,Nah he had cancer for a while
Elijah Parker,Aw damn.
Elijah Parker,Well. Rip.
Austin Medina,Damn nigga thats sad
Elijah Parker,I mean idk anything really about the guy but yeah I agree. Rip.
Austin Medina,Damn i didnt know he was so rich lol
Elijah Parker,Holy fuck.
Elijah Parker,You could literally buy and run a small country for 500 million.
Samuel Adams,Howard Stern still the big chad of talk show radio
Elijah Parker,I can't even imagine 500 million dollars in a physical form.
Elijah Parker,Like.
Elijah Parker,That's literally like at least an Olympic swimming pool just stuffed to the brim with cash.
Elijah Parker,Fuckin hell
Austin Medina,I would be content with 1 million mr limbaugh
Elijah Parker,I'm supposed to be getting about $2200
Elijah Parker,"So probably about 500-600 to my grandparents, 150 for whatever I decide to get London, probably going to be saving 400 or so and the rest is pretty much free reign."
Samuel Adams,Shit if you're getting 2200 I'd save even more of that
Elijah Parker,Well.
Samuel Adams,You'd be surprised how far it can go if you don't purchase the smock
Elijah Parker,See the thing is I want to be able to just ride it until job corps.
Elijah Parker,So I've got nothing to spend after I get in there.
Elijah Parker,Besides basic necessities
Elijah Parker,I do need new clothes more than anything though.
Elijah Parker,All my pants keep falling off my ass.
Elijah Parker,And also.
Elijah Parker,Eddie how much do I owe you lad?
Elijah Parker,J
Elijah Parker,Do I owe you anything?
J Cole Patt,how i drug deal
Elijah Parker,Okay.
J Cole Patt,20 dollaroonies
Elijah Parker,Alright gotchu. I'll let you know once I've got it.
Elijah Parker,Sam.
Elijah Parker,Do I owe you anything?
Samuel Adams,Just a fat fuckin hug brother
Elijah Parker,Also @Austin Medina do I owe you anything?
Elijah Parker,ððð I gotchu babes
Austin Medina,Nope not a thing brother
Austin Medina,"According to my return site i should be getting around that much too, imma just throw it all into a savings account"
Elijah Parker,Alright cool. I just don't want to owe anyone anything before I go to job corps.
Elijah Parker,Can confirm that's not the case.
Elijah Parker,London is like 5'9 and can't even fit half my dick in her.
Elijah Parker,Don't tell her I said that though ððð
J Cole Patt,for some reason this taller girl could fit half of me but this one short girl could fit nearly all.
J Cole Patt,and it was the weirdest thing when i fucked that tall girl.
Elijah Parker,I find it easier.
Elijah Parker,I don't need to adjust myself as much.
Elijah Parker,Eddie.
Elijah Parker,You're here.
Elijah Parker,How much do I owe you laddie?
Elijah Parker,Fuck I don't want it to get buried under conversation so @Degan Nestrichal
Austin Medina,Im that guy that can drive stick at work now
Elijah Parker,Poggers
Degan Nestrichal,15 cuz the pizza was 30 in total and we are the only ones who ate
Elijah Parker,Alright b I gotchu.
Degan Nestrichal,also ye save more
Elijah Parker,That pizza was fucking bomb btw
Degan Nestrichal,survival of the fittest eli only pay if someone makes u
Samuel Adams,Like Eddie! You better not fucking pay him unless he's holding you at gunpoint!
Degan Nestrichal,*except for eddie
Degan Nestrichal,only pay eddie or else he will send the chupacabra gang from mexico to snuff u out
Elijah Parker,They're my grandparents I live with tho. I eat their food and drink their drinks and they get cigarettes for ya boy and on and on. They deserve some of that money laddie.
J Cole Patt,rip
Samuel Adams,We're not saying to take it from that pile though
Degan Nestrichal,ur choice but if they are doing well im sure they would prefer u to be doing well eli
Samuel Adams,Give your grandparents as much as you'd like but I'd set aside less for day to day spending and more for saving especially if you're gonna be going to job corps
Elijah Parker,"While I get what you guys are saying, why?"
Samuel Adams,Well actually let's not get into this because we'll inevitably start talking about banks and investments lol
Elijah Parker,"Like what am I going to need so desperately at job Corps 25 bucks a week won't pay for it? They pay for my food, housing, bed stuff, activities, and so on."
J Cole Patt,The etc
Degan Nestrichal,idk i would be uncomfortable personally if someone i knew that didnt have much money gave me 400-500 if i was fully capable
Elijah Parker,"Like all I'll really need is shampoo and conditioner, deodorant and toothpaste lol."
Samuel Adams,"Exactly my point, this way you'll have the money waiting for you once you leave and it's not like it's going to be spent because everything is provided for you"
Elijah Parker,I mean true.
Elijah Parker,What do you guys suggest I save then?
Samuel Adams,It's not spending money for job corps it's for whatever you wanna do after it
Samuel Adams,Probably a thousand or so at least
Degan Nestrichal,as much as u can tbh
Elijah Parker,I mean that's fair. I'll do my best.
Degan Nestrichal,but what i really mean to say eli is wait until ur on ur feet with a good job out of job corps and then pay back ur grandparents
Degan Nestrichal,use this money to get to that point
Elijah Parker,That's also fair. I guess that's a good idea I just usually think about helping anyone else before myself yk? That makes sense though. Thanks for the advice guys.
Degan Nestrichal,"lol imagine taking advice from sam, a broke nigga who dont have a car doe ð"
Samuel Adams,"Of course money is made to be spent anyway so don't be afraid to splurge on a little something for yourself or London or anyone really, but you should really try to hold on to at least half of that money for any possible gray area you might fall into after job corps where you could get a job but don't have one"
Samuel Adams,"Silence Eddie, lest I tell everyone you copied my subway order! ðð"
Degan Nestrichal,"blasphemy i went italian herbs and cheese -> spicy italian -> provolone -> toasted -> lettuce, spinach, onions, chipotle"
J Cole Patt,in the drug world its called backup
J Cole Patt,Or in polotics
J Cole Patt,its called debt
J Cole Patt,altho
J Cole Patt,they never pay it back
J Cole Patt,Lol
Degan Nestrichal,literally who gets anything but spicy italian from subway
J Cole Patt,....
J Cole Patt,So uh
J Cole Patt,Not me but uhhhh
Samuel Adams,The sweet onion chicken teriyaki is pretty good
J Cole Patt,Lmao
Elijah Parker,That's also fair. I hope there won't be a grey area though honestly. They're supposed to be helping me with finding a job before I even leave. Like they're a federal program so they've got a few companies they have students apply for depending on what courses you take.
Elijah Parker,I like the meatball bomber from subway tbh.
Elijah Parker,"Sometimes with green peppers, most of the time not."
Degan Nestrichal,its prob  decent but isnt it like 9 dollars
Elijah Parker,Italian Herbs and cheese bread fucking SLAPS though eddie I agree.
Elijah Parker,If you get a foot long maybe.
Degan Nestrichal,no i mean sweet onion chicken
Elijah Parker,Oh lmao.
Samuel Adams,I don't even remember I haven't gotten it in years
Elijah Parker,I was gonna say usually I get a 6 inch and that's like. 4 dollars or so?
Degan Nestrichal,u can only handle 6 inches?
Elijah Parker,There's this super good place at Carthage called Sub Connection that has delicious subs.
J Cole Patt,xD
Elijah Parker,Fuck u it's still bigger than you lad ð
Elijah Parker,Nah I'm just kidding.
Degan Nestrichal,about equal actually!
Degan Nestrichal,"get it right fucker, 6 inches is fucking ginormous"
Elijah Parker,But yeah no a foot long with the meatballs and marinara and mozzarella is way too much lad.
Samuel Adams,Being part of GAY Club gets you an honorary footlong even if you don't possess a real one
Samuel Adams,Women can't tell the difference
Elijah Parker,Wait do you guys usually eat foot longs from subway?
Degan Nestrichal,this reminds me of this one onion skit
Elijah Parker,Lmao I always thought they were meant for two people.
Elijah Parker,Or at least two meals.
Elijah Parker,Especially with the meatball ones.
Samuel Adams,I always save half of it for later ye
J Cole Patt,"Hey eddie, u available to tutor sometime today?"
Degan Nestrichal,if u fund my mein kampf server
Samuel Adams,We should add the serene seasons mod to the fuckin server
J Cole Patt,yes we need to discuss those terms.
J Cole Patt,im willin to pitch in
Samuel Adams,"And mystcraft, you can make your own dimensions"
Samuel Adams,In fact I kinda want to build a modpack honestly
Samuel Adams,"Harvestcraft, serene seasons, biomes o plenty, mystcraft, galacticraft, silent gear, more animals, just to name a few"
Elijah Parker,Hell yeah I can't play but if you guys will stream I've got a few good mods to recommend.
J Cole Patt,i just have a 8 page thing tbh
Elijah Parker,V descriptive
J Cole Patt,2 questions each with very shitty questions
J Cole Patt,that i do not understand
Elijah Parker,What
J Cole Patt,calc
Elijah Parker,Oh lmao.
Elijah Parker,I thought you were talking about minecraft mods
Samuel Adams,Got a negative covid test boys
Samuel Adams,After all the shit I've done I am no worse for wear
Elijah Parker,Ayyyy
J Cole Patt,kek
Degan Nestrichal,shit i couldnt tell if this was J or my 12 year old nephew for a sec
Elijah Parker,Who was it?
Degan Nestrichal,can one of u guys see if u can register with this? its apparently a free $100 credit for cloud space
Degan Nestrichal,"thats a good server for 2.5 months, it wont let me register tho"
Austin Medina,I wanna get a tattoo
Degan Nestrichal,idk i personally would never get a tattoo becuz they are sins against God
Austin Medina,U right nvm
Degan Nestrichal,were u able to sign up sam? did u check it out
J Cole Patt,Join vc eddie
Degan Nestrichal,if some1 can sign up with that link its legit a free high quality modded server for 2 months
Degan Nestrichal,idk why its being gay for me though
Samuel Adams,Lemme take a look at it
J Cole Patt,Join vc and i shall
Elijah Parker,I wanna get a tattoo too lol
Elijah Parker,Maybe two actually.
Austin Medina,Sam be like i love diesel exhaust fluid leppars
Elijah Parker,Austino
Elijah Parker,You want to get a tattoo lad?
Austin Medina,Idk kinda
Austin Medina,Why
Elijah Parker,I may know a guy.
Elijah Parker,Who says he'd tattoo me for free.
J Cole Patt,RIP
Austin Medina,Lmao im good
J Cole Patt,Theres a guy over in zion that does shit good
Elijah Parker,Lmao I'm kidding I'm kidding
J Cole Patt,He will kick his kid across the room just to make sure ur tat is high quality.
Austin Medina,I know a guy that tatted ben franklins dad @Degan Nestrichal
Elijah Parker,But he'd tattoo you for fairly cheap yeah. He did my brother's tattoo one sec I'll show you it.
Elijah Parker,This was like. 20 bucks
Degan Nestrichal,shit austin i know this guy who does it out of an alley and is such a green citizen that he actually recycles needles and puts them to good use <3
Elijah Parker,Lmfao
Elijah Parker,Nah he's a family friend
J Cole Patt,youll get high af when hes using them too
Austin Medina,Imma go to an established shop i think
Elijah Parker,That's fair bro
Degan Nestrichal,"i got a better google server, dunno how long its gonna last with credits but its smoother"
Degan Nestrichal,the nice thing about the server tho is that it only subtracts credits from when u use the server and its like 5 cents an hour or something like that
Degan Nestrichal,if i had it on the entire month itd rack up 40 bucks but if i were to play on it for a few hours every day itd be a few dollars a month
Samuel Adams,Austin be like ð
Degan Nestrichal,or u could get a suzuki forenza for 3300 with 30k miles dafuq lol
Degan Nestrichal,2004
Samuel Adams,I have no desire to try and hunt down suzuki parts when they inevitably fail
Elijah Parker,Suzuki racist Sam
Degan Nestrichal,sam is so mad he cant afford a forenza lol!
Samuel Adams,I think 2006 Corollas were decent and Corollas tend to be above the curve anyway
Samuel Adams,I'd wager you could get 200k more miles out of this thing
J Cole Patt,Austin be like
Austin Medina,that dealership is probably trash tho
Austin Medina,ive seen their reviews
Austin Medina,car planet or whatever
J Cole Patt,"""yeah, this weed has a 2gz ram, from 2008 made my american mechanics, not mexican ones"""
Degan Nestrichal,what am i gonna drive 200k miles for.. u buy ur first car with the intention of replacing it once u get a job anyways
Austin Medina,but yeah if that was well maintained lmfao thats an incredible deal toyotas do not break
Samuel Adams,"I mean, not necessarily"
J Cole Patt,actually that b true
Degan Nestrichal,most im gonna drive in a few years is literally like 30-40k
Elijah Parker,And then u fuckin dab
Degan Nestrichal,probably even less tbh
Austin Medina,lmao nah eddie ur tripping
Elijah Parker,die***
J Cole Patt,i hope to drove my vk for 10 years then maybe replace it
Samuel Adams,If I got a good car that's going to last a while I don't wanna get rid of it any time soon
Austin Medina,my goal is to drive my cars into the ground and stack cash until i can get what i actually really want
Degan Nestrichal,200k miles is literally like a decade of someone who travels
Samuel Adams,Especially because it's easy to maintain toyotas on top of a parts surplus for them
Samuel Adams,This is all asuming I get a toyota down the line kek
Austin Medina,i wanna be able to buy a car i want in cash instead of financing
Degan Nestrichal,austin i have the same goal
Degan Nestrichal,y cant u see
Austin Medina,then all i gotta pay for is insurance and extended warranty
Degan Nestrichal,lmao extended warranty
Austin Medina,wym lmao
Elijah Parker,hi
Austin Medina,bitch
Austin Medina,>:(
Elijah Parker,:(:(
Degan Nestrichal,austin trust me bro no insurance is a good luck charm
Samuel Adams,I was reading up on used car sale laws in WI and apparently WI is one of the few states where you don't get an implied warranty for buying a used good
Austin Medina,extended warranty is just insurance for unseen major repairs
Degan Nestrichal,ive gotten 1 no insurance ticket at it was 80
Degan Nestrichal,thats prob less than what u spend on insurance and warranty every month
Austin Medina,i dont have warranty lmao
Austin Medina,my jeep is older than me
Samuel Adams,And lemon laws only apply if it's a new car and it dies within like 20k miles iirc
Austin Medina,"extended warranty is 100% worth it depending on what car you get,  if you get a luxury car that is prone to breaking like alfa romeo or land rover you are protecting your future self unless you plan on selling it before it gets to the point where it should have major issues"
Austin Medina,if you get like a toyota tho thats no issue
Degan Nestrichal,just get the cheapest car sam god
Samuel Adams,"See in J's case I would definitely recommend he gets rid of his vw as soon as he can, because vws are cool but they are a bitch to maintain if they start breaking down"
Austin Medina,that is actually pretty fucked tho but what if you get in an accident eddie thats my main concern
Degan Nestrichal,ur not gonna use it in 3-4 years anyways when ur rich and get a alfa romeo!
Degan Nestrichal,if i get into an accident and its their fault then ill have to pay for my own car repairs but i wont have to pay them anything
Degan Nestrichal,the amount of times ive come close to serious car accidents is less than 5 tbh
Samuel Adams,"Ok eddie I will purchase a rusted truck frame from 1978 and push it with my feet flintstones style, I think this is the most economical way for me to get around until I can sell it and get something better"
Austin Medina,damn i dont think ive ever been close to a serious accident lmao
Degan Nestrichal,well i mean
Degan Nestrichal,i guess it depends on what u mean by close
Degan Nestrichal,like if i was looking somewhere else for example i mighta gotten hit
Austin Medina,i see
Degan Nestrichal,but then again im not a stupid zoomer that is on their phones 25/7
Austin Medina,probably the shadiest shit actually was when we almost lost traction on the highway going 60 on saturday lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,i felt that xd
Austin Medina,"i wonder what wouldve happened if we got sideways, hopefully everyone would have been paying attention and not hit me going 140 mph"
Degan Nestrichal,its ok tho austin if we died in a car crash that day no one woulda cared we are degenerate humans xD
Samuel Adams,Car flippity flops and I have no seatbelt on = brain hemorrhage and death xd
Austin Medina,dude then we would have never ruined those nice girls days!
Austin Medina,wait did you not have ur seatbelt on
Austin Medina,LMFAO
Samuel Adams,I told you this
Austin Medina,NO FUGGING WAY
Degan Nestrichal,"dude then sam woulda never said ""man im gonna regret fucking you guys later"", and them subsequently leaving!"
Austin Medina,this nigga nearly died
Samuel Adams,The fuckin buckles were still under the bench lmao
Austin Medina,kek
Austin Medina,i found a grand cherokee at work that i like but holy fuck would it be expensive to repair
Degan Nestrichal,sam u should get a diesel bike bro its the most economical way to get around
Elijah Parker,Good car
Elijah Parker,10/10 would recommend.
Austin Medina,sam i got u bro ill find you the perfect first car rn
Elijah Parker,100% clean on CarFax
Samuel Adams,Plot twist: it's RWD
Elijah Parker,Kelly Bluebook?
Austin Medina,here u go
Elijah Parker,Over a mil kid you wouldn't be able to afford it.
Elijah Parker,LMFAO
Samuel Adams,"Fuck, 44 miles? This thing is already at the end of its lifespan"
Austin Medina,lmfao
Elijah Parker,I was talking about the truck sarcastically and austin actually pulls out a car over half a mil.
Degan Nestrichal,"aiden moores like ""if only i saved up my trust fund money for 2 years ð¥ºð"""
Samuel Adams,Mclaren Sennas are batshit insane though
Austin Medina,i actually drove a cool car you would maybe like today
Austin Medina,"it was a chevy sonic rs, 6speed manual, heated seats, sporty looking trim lol"
Austin Medina,shit was cool
Austin Medina,yeah id like to set up financing on my mclaren
Austin Medina,dont get a cvt either get an automatic or manual trans
Austin Medina,cvt is weird as fuck and expensive to repair
Elijah Parker,You're weird as fuck and expensive to repair
Austin Medina,i know lmfao
Elijah Parker,ððð
Austin Medina,"i felt like the man driving that chevy sonic tho bruh, the mechanic had to ask me to move it :D"
Austin Medina,since it was stick
Samuel Adams,Austin can only be repaired by buying more extravagant and more expensive vehicles
Elijah Parker,Bro austin you should always feel like a man bro you've got a cock
Austin Medina,nah nah nah
Austin Medina,i felt like THEE man
Elijah Parker,At least I think. I haven't seen it so I can't be for sure.
Elijah Parker,PH FUK
Elijah Parker,Sorry mate I'm kinda baked
Degan Nestrichal,if u guys all buy suzukis their stock will go up bro
Elijah Parker,We chillin in the chilly
Austin Medina,this is the best deal ive found so far
Degan Nestrichal,how tf is sam gonna acquire 8k
Austin Medina,get a job
Degan Nestrichal,austin ur talking to sam not aiden moore geez
Degan Nestrichal,austin ive never saved up 8k despite frugal spending and working in a warehouse
Samuel Adams,I'll sell the intellectual property rights to all 100+ songs/lyrics/poems I've ever written there must be somebody out there who wants them
Degan Nestrichal,google already owns it fool! they just dont know it yet!
Austin Medina,my coworker is 23 and has like 22k saved idek how the fuck he did it but i gotta be better than him thats why i wanna save like 10k this year
Elijah Parker,Bro he lives like a Sim bro.
Elijah Parker,He gets 22K to start out his adult life duh!
Austin Medina,hes kind of a bitch tbh lmao
Degan Nestrichal,he probably steals napkins from chipotle and takes extra ketchup from mcdonalds
Degan Nestrichal,thats the real secret
Elijah Parker,What a mad man
Austin Medina,i was tryna train up with the apprentices today and learn about how to mount tires but he was in the body shop fucking around instead of being up front
Degan Nestrichal,austin bet ill be 23 and have more saved than u
Degan Nestrichal,u have a headstart tho
Austin Medina,"you probably will, you gonna work every summer?"
Degan Nestrichal,yeah
Elijah Parker,Bet I'll have the least saved up by then lmao
Austin Medina,just cut costs
Degan Nestrichal,if i dont get a job right away tho or if something is effecting the job market then ill be fked for a while
Austin Medina,throw a certain amount into an account and pretend you dont have it at your disposal
Austin Medina,repeat every week or whatever the pay period is
Degan Nestrichal,only spend on groceries and just feed on anything anyone gives u
Degan Nestrichal,and DONT BUY CAR INSURANCE ITS A GOOD LUCK CHARM!
Austin Medina,imma be a mechanic :D
Austin Medina,maybe if i get to the point where im actually concerned about the physical side effects of trade work ill try to be a service writer tho
Austin Medina,which is like a salesman for auto repairs
Austin Medina,them mfs can make serious bank
Austin Medina,like 6 figures
Elijah Parker,Bro you like.
Elijah Parker,Really fuckin like cars
Austin Medina,yeah thats why i wanna work in automotive
Samuel Adams,The good thing is he can make money off of his passion kek
Elijah Parker,That's true
Degan Nestrichal,when u start turning it into a job tho u lose the passion austino
Austin Medina,we'll see
Elijah Parker,I've just never met someone so invested in a mode of transportation.
Elijah Parker,Like.
Austin Medina,its more than that
Samuel Adams,"To me that basically sounds like the moment you start earning money, everything becomes dull"
Elijah Parker,What about trains
Austin Medina,cars are art bro
Elijah Parker,Or fuckin
Elijah Parker,Boats and airplanes and helicopters and shit
Elijah Parker,Or bicycles bro
Austin Medina,plus i like going fast so i wanna learn how to make cars go faster
Degan Nestrichal,its more of corporate practices and being forced to constantly learn about stuff or do something
Degan Nestrichal,rather than do all this at ur leisure
Elijah Parker,Like is it only just cars or is it transportation in general
Austin Medina,one of my buddies at work was talking about opening up a performance shop where he would do custom builds and installs of performance parts
Austin Medina,sounds like a fuckin good idea to me
Elijah Parker,Bro what about golf carts
Samuel Adams,If that's true then I'm already at an advantage because I have no such perspective on my career prospects lol
Elijah Parker,Mfin skateboards
Degan Nestrichal,"whatever u do, take pride in it"
Elijah Parker,Skates?
Elijah Parker,Roller blades?
Samuel Adams,I know it's probably going to be glum the moment I walk in the door I won't have to have a bubble popped
Austin Medina,"im naturally interested in how these systems work, automotive engineering tends to be really interesting to me, i dont see myself getting burned out, but if i do the money can make up for it if i get to that journeyman level"
Elijah Parker,ATVs? Motorcycles?
Austin Medina,motorcycles are cool too
Elijah Parker,Fuckin rocket ships and moon rovers?
Austin Medina,those are kinda cool
Elijah Parker,Bro
Elijah Parker,What about horses bro
Samuel Adams,I mean school is pretty boring but as long as I can juggle it I'm perfectly happy to keep going with the shit I do
Austin Medina,some people are passionate about horses
Elijah Parker,those are also transportation depending on if ur a fuckin cowboy or not
Degan Nestrichal,"its the same reason y ppl get burnt out making music or doing youtube, corporations take over, agencies take over, capitalism works against the human psyche\"
Elijah Parker,Troop transports?
Elijah Parker,Freight liners?
Elijah Parker,Yachts?
Elijah Parker,Rowboats?
Elijah Parker,Speedboats?
Austin Medina,i just wanna work on cars its that simple
Elijah Parker,Jet skis?
Austin Medina,ill figure out the other shit because i have to
Elijah Parker,Recreational vehicles?
Austin Medina,eli what are you talking about
Elijah Parker,Fuckin sailboats
Degan Nestrichal,no austin u must ponder on existentialism and nihilism until you become depressed til the day u die like friedrich nietzsche
Samuel Adams,My main concern is probably ending up alone and/or losing the passion for the things I enjoy
Elijah Parker,Tugboats
Austin Medina,"nah im a lot more of a bloomer nowadays than anything, im excited for the future"
Samuel Adams,I can handle everything else as long as I've got a fighting chance in either arena
Elijah Parker,Those bicycles with huge fuckin front wheels?
Degan Nestrichal,me 2 austino
Elijah Parker,Submarines?
Austin Medina,"any day above ground is a good one my friends, do what you want, achieve your goals :D"
Elijah Parker,Fuckin fishing vessels?
Austin Medina,lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,submarines are just submissive marine corps i just realized this
Degan Nestrichal,no wonder they are far down below
Elijah Parker,What about diving in general actually?
Elijah Parker,Wouldn't you want to explore the oceans?
Samuel Adams,I just hope my goals mean something when I get chucked into the dirt
Elijah Parker,Sea everything this world is hiding under those waves?
Austin Medina,"that sounds cool to me but at the same time bro, if something goes wrong i would be so shook"
Elijah Parker,Bro
Elijah Parker,I want to fuckin be underwater rn
Austin Medina,"it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks of those goals or anything like that, all you have in this world is how you see things, thats what you can control"
Elijah Parker,I want to feel seaweed against my legs.
Austin Medina,decide whats important and it will be my doggie
Elijah Parker,Pet the fish that swim by.
Elijah Parker,Feel the waves
Elijah Parker,Fuck
Elijah Parker,I'm rambling my b
Degan Nestrichal,thats so fucking true austin!!! except for the fact that everyone cares about what other ppl think!! its part of our human nature!
Austin Medina,yeah LMAO
Elijah Parker,I'm sorry.
Samuel Adams,It's not so much about what others think about the goals as it is being able to enjoy their fulfillment and then one day it's just black nothing and boom you can't appreciate your fucking goals anymore! Or your family or friends! It's so fucking stupid!
Austin Medina,i still care about what others think im just gonna do what i wanna do
Elijah Parker,I just think being underwater is so cool.
Samuel Adams,"I'm gonna die having missed out on some cool books! Some cool songs And the ones I've already read and listened to won't mean a damn because I won't be around to talk about them or consider their existence! God I demand you patch out death immediately, motherfucker!"
Degan Nestrichal,u dont die sam its a lie
Degan Nestrichal,lmao stupid nigga
Elijah Parker,You just wake up underwater.
Austin Medina,sam bro youre thinking too much
Elijah Parker,Then you can swim with the fishes.
Samuel Adams,I've thought entirely too much for the past 3 months
Samuel Adams,Not much I can do about it now
Degan Nestrichal,based and blackpilled
Austin Medina,im sure thats a side effect of being inside for the majority of the time and not being able to go anywhere or do anything fulfilling
Austin Medina,this nigga needs to start lifting if you ask me
Austin Medina,! :D
Samuel Adams,But see the funny thing about that is I have always lived this way whether or not covid was going on so why would it start now
Samuel Adams,I think I was just inevitably always going to reach these conclusions and covid merely accelerated its arrival
Degan Nestrichal,"ive been tryna disconnect from anything with existentialism or any form of nihilism, absurdism, etc. its all just a stupid way to end up depressed"
Austin Medina,just conquer bro
Austin Medina,"lift heavy, get a gf, impregnate, acquire milkers"
Austin Medina,ITS THAT FUCKING SIMPLE
Elijah Parker,Non
Degan Nestrichal,then do it austin
Elijah Parker,Don't have crotch demons
Austin Medina,im still on stop one
Austin Medina,step
Elijah Parker,They cost too much and bring more pain than joy.
Austin Medina,"lmao no one will talk me out of having kids, god willing"
Degan Nestrichal,kids be little shits but im sure when im >30 i might change my mind
Elijah Parker,Get a vasectomy then you can hit it raw and bust inside with no worries
Austin Medina,vasectomies are for pussies
Elijah Parker,Keep some sperm in a sperm bank just in case.
Samuel Adams,I definitely want a family of some kind
Elijah Parker,Lmao how tf is getting your balls cut open for pussies lad
Austin Medina,if your balls dont work you might as well be a woman bro!
Austin Medina,simple as!
Elijah Parker,You can still cum you fuckin idiot.
Samuel Adams,More than anything else I'd like to share my life with someone and maybe even beget new life from the union
Austin Medina,whats the point of a vasectomy
Austin Medina,to prevent pregnancy no?
Elijah Parker,"Not getting chicks you want to fuck now pregnant, not to have kids, etc etc."
Samuel Adams,But I also don't have any desire to seek out women atm because I'm not where I'd like to be
Elijah Parker,Just save some in the bank bro simple as.
Austin Medina,i dont rly wanna fuck chicks unless i wanna kids with them tho
Samuel Adams,"Especially mentally, I cannot on good conscience have my ramblings become someone else's problem"
Degan Nestrichal,"dang austin so if one of those girls threw themselves on u u woulda been like ""nah i dont wanna have kids with u rn"""
Austin Medina,tbh probably lmfao
Austin Medina,i was drunk tho maybe i would have fucked if possible
Degan Nestrichal,sam ur existential ramblings are already our problem transfer them to some unsuspecting girl then we wont feel any pain
Samuel Adams,Nah man I think I legitimately need to get some kind of therapy in the near future lmao fuck this shit
Samuel Adams,Almost feels like I've been condemned to feel this way
Austin Medina,"too much idle time will do this, take on more responsibility wherever possible"
Austin Medina,trust me
Degan Nestrichal,fuck sam now ur condemning me to feel that way!
Samuel Adams,Haha deal with it loser! The good thing is that all things shall pass and so will your rotten mood!
Degan Nestrichal,having a job does help with this to an extent but i think its just the phase of life we are in rn
Austin Medina,everything around you is fucked but you dont have to be
Degan Nestrichal,like fk u ever just look at an old person and be like damn they are running out of time and i wonder how they feel about it
Samuel Adams,It's that + the fact that things have to get old in the first place and that everything is subject to this fate
Samuel Adams,I almost don't wanna talk about the way I feel because I legitimately don't want anyone else to come to the same conclusions I do and then feel the same subtle existential dread lmao
Degan Nestrichal,fuck sam you've cursed me to think this way! i was never an existentialist idiot until now
Samuel Adams,Secrets better kept to oneself
Samuel Adams,"Exactly, that's what I'm talking about"
Samuel Adams,"Trust me, it can get worse"
Austin Medina,Just acknowledge that you can not control any of this and work towards achieving what u want
Austin Medina,If you reach those goals set higher ones
Austin Medina,Its not even about the goal its about the journey
Austin Medina,As is life ðº
Samuel Adams,Well my goal is to never die so I can enjoy my accomplishments forever
Degan Nestrichal,just drink bleach its immortal juice
Austin Medina,Too bad bitch
Austin Medina,"Thats life, this is where were at"
Austin Medina,Unless u can change the situation its probably best not to worry all too much
Degan Nestrichal,but yeah id rather just be facetitious with a lot of things and condemn myself to being a normie in some regards than going 100% redpill nihlist
Austin Medina,Are you misusing redpill or am i retarded
Samuel Adams,I would much MUCH rather be an oblivious idiot than to be whatever I am now
Austin Medina,I thought that meant right eing
Austin Medina,Wing
Degan Nestrichal,no its just any uncomfortable truth
Samuel Adams,Unless I can somehow profit off of my existential musings
Degan Nestrichal,lmao have u never seen the matrix
Samuel Adams,"This would be so much easier if I cared more about college and my career path than how I'm going to make the most out of life, which ironically is wasted when you spend so much time thinking about it"
Austin Medina,You could spend a thousand years talking yourself out of doing what you want and demanding the best for yourself or just do it and enjoy the ride
Austin Medina,"Its your life you have the right, maybe even obligation to be the best person you can be"
Degan Nestrichal,thats true its mostly thinking about the future rather than living in the present
Degan Nestrichal,i feel like this might be a COVID thing too tho i would feel like i was doing much more if i was in college and interacting with other ppl everyday
Austin Medina,Marcus aurelius would argue a man is not entitled to spend the morning hours resting when there is work to be done
Samuel Adams,"I so wish I was religious too, at least that could give me some comfort"
Austin Medina,Couldnt agree more social interaction is so important
Samuel Adams,But I can't entirely convince myself of any of it
Austin Medina,Anyway imma lift because i wanna be big
Degan Nestrichal,austin ur never gonna get to my obese weight just give up idiot
Austin Medina,Probably true unfortunately
Austin Medina,5'6 nfl players rarely exceed like 170 i think so im fkd
Austin Medina,I think 140 would be solid for me
Samuel Adams,You are NEVER going to weigh more than 122 pounds!
Austin Medina,I was like 130
Austin Medina,Smh idk where it went
Samuel Adams,Also apparently I got a robinhood cash card in the mail lmao
Samuel Adams,I have 15 bucks on the bitch let's go I was considering just liquidating the account and closing it but maybe not
Degan Nestrichal,i could prob get to a healthy 190-200 being jacked but id rather be toned and like 170-180
Austin Medina,LOL I forgot to declare my stocks on taxes and I freaked out for a little bit but I got the 1099 from Robinhood and I don't think I had to declare it anyway
Austin Medina,"I wanna be functionally strong, if imma be a tradesman i gotta be stronger"
Degan Nestrichal,its ok austin tax evasion is good when its against the rich
Samuel Adams,What's with this fucking SLV huh Austin? You're baiting us into bad stock purchases huh Austin? Motherfucker!
Degan Nestrichal,"shit its actually up sam, we probably wanna sell tmrw"
Samuel Adams,I'm debating selling it once it breaks even but theoretically a security tied to a commodity shouldn't go down right
Degan Nestrichal,invest in something else cuz this idiot austin listens to anything reddit tells him! classical redditor!
Degan Nestrichal,prob wont go down yeah but honestly its gonna go up so slow that its literally like the same rate as a savings account
Degan Nestrichal,which at that point why r u even investing in the stock market
Samuel Adams,Breaking news: Huge fucking chunk of silver discovered in Tanzania! Silver price plummets!
Austin Medina,Nah bruh i made bank off sndl without anyones help âï¸ð³ðð¤£ð
Samuel Adams,Sundial is already down bad again
Austin Medina,Yeah i sold already
Samuel Adams,Still gotta get into weed before it becomes federally legal and then quickly get the fuck out of it
Austin Medina,Made like 200 bucks in 2 days
Samuel Adams,"Or maybe get rid of half of my stock and just see what the other half does, maybe it'll skyrocket I dunno"
Samuel Adams,Until dispensaries can compete with street prices legal weed isn't going to be very popular I feel
Samuel Adams,And I have it on good authority that @J Cole Patt has been ordered to kill anyone who is investing in legal weed because it is a direct threat to his business! Be advised!
J Cole Patt,Nah my contract expired
Degan Nestrichal,J tell us in morse code what u did the NSA is too stupid to decipher it trust me
Degan Nestrichal,.- ..- ... - .. -. / -- . -.. .. -. .- / .-- .. .-.. .-.. / -. --- - / -.. . -.-. .. .--. .... . .-. / - .... .. ... / -- . ... ... .- --. . / -... . -.-. .- ..- ... . / .... . / .. ... / .- / .-.. .- --.. -.-- / -... --- --- -- . .-. / ..-. ..- -.-. -.- / - .... .- - / .--- ..- ... - / .-- .- -. - ... / .- / ..-. .- - / - .. - - . -.. / .-.. .- - .. -. .- / --. ..-.
Samuel Adams,The real question is
Samuel Adams,Should I buy the dip on Sundial xd
Degan Nestrichal,i stopped giving any investment advice or intuition after i lost my sister prob like 250 on novavax
Samuel Adams,After you told me that story I always wanna at least two shares of anything lol
Samuel Adams,Sell one and keep the other if it's something volatile
Degan Nestrichal,luckily she only sold 5
Degan Nestrichal,out of 13
Samuel Adams,"But sundial is so down right now that I might just put a limit order for like 1.80, get 5 shares or so"
Samuel Adams,What would you suggest austino
Austin Medina,"Yeah wait like until an hour after market open i would say, you could end up buying and then it could crash again"
Austin Medina,Then again ur talking about like 10 bucks so it wouldnt that bad
Samuel Adams,I gotta start getting up at respectable times if I want to actually participate in investing lmao
Samuel Adams,I only get up at 8:30 on Mondays because I have to and today was a special case because I had to get a covid test at 10
Samuel Adams,The other days? Fuk it sleeping in til noon
Austin Medina,Getting up early is some boss shit
J Cole Patt,... ---...
J Cole Patt,.... . .-.. .--.
J Cole Patt,I know morse code
J Cole Patt,Kek
Austin Medina,Fug im tired
Austin Medina,That was a good sesh
Austin Medina,Just gotta listen to some Schwarzenegger speeches to get pumped
Austin Medina,Sam u should just start going to the gym bro
Austin Medina,Itll be awkward as fuck at first im sure
Austin Medina,"Ill go with u tho, i kind of have everything i need or want at home for lifting but i think it would be both fun and beneficial"
Samuel Adams,"For sure, I've been talking to a guy at Marquette to go to the gym with as well"
Samuel Adams,Gains at home and at school let's go
Degan Nestrichal,austin i thot u said u didnt wanna go to the gym in keno u fk!
Austin Medina,I still kinda dont wanna go to a public gym but its a fear i must conquer
Austin Medina,Fuck bros did we miss out on bitcoin
Degan Nestrichal,austin is so scared that the barks are gonna laugh at him xD
Degan Nestrichal,buy ethereum
Austin Medina,A lot of major instutions are buying btc
Degan Nestrichal,or monero
Degan Nestrichal,i meant to say *chads btw
Degan Nestrichal,idk where barks came from XD
Austin Medina,The barks lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,but yeah ethereum is a good buy
Austin Medina,"Nah not worried about that, chads are just losers who are further along on the journey to the good life"
Degan Nestrichal,the thing is tho with any crypto is that they are volatile as fuck
Degan Nestrichal,they can easily fluncuate 20-40% of their stock worth in a day
Austin Medina,"Me lift heavy rock, make sad head voice be quiet"
Austin Medina,Its that simple sam
Degan Nestrichal,god sam all u need is to workout and get a latina GF to impregnate bruv so simple lmao XD
Samuel Adams,It's true! Goddamnit why didn't I think of it sooner!
Samuel Adams,I'll be honest tho I was markedly more happy second semester of senior year when I was taking a weight lifting class
Samuel Adams,There's probably truth to this
Samuel Adams,Too bad there was fucking drama at every turn! Fuck high school!
Austin Medina,Lmao drama in lifting like what
Degan Nestrichal,"yeah aiden moore said his dick was so fat that he could bench the bar using only the tip and brian leconte called it cap, and aiden threatened to sue and enslave brian onto his dads gardening business it got intense af"
Samuel Adams,Nah I was caught between two sides because I was too pussywhipped to know better and I had time on my side
Samuel Adams,"Namely, I wouldn't have to see most of these people ever again"
Austin Medina,Ah shit yeah i remember when i was involved in gang activity
Degan Nestrichal,what do u mean sam ive seen grace a handful of times and always say hey hows it going its such an intense encounter
Samuel Adams,"Long story short, rakel got jealous because she was deeply convinced her best friend was into me and it got messy"
Degan Nestrichal,who was this
Samuel Adams,Ended up cutting a lot of chicks who I considered friends which was stupid
Samuel Adams,Claire
Samuel Adams,I was doing weightlifting with Augusta and she was sort of acting as an informant because I was too oblivious to realize at the time that she wasn't just a well-meaning friend lmao
Austin Medina,Yeah fuck a suspicious ass bitch
Samuel Adams,In hindsight I probably chose the outcome that was better off for me but it's still silly that it had to come to that in the first place
Samuel Adams,"But for a brief time, I was in a good relationship, doing well in school, looking forward to college, and actively improving myself"
Degan Nestrichal,"thats why u date latinas bro, according to austin they are amazing housewife women who suck your dick 3 times a day! no exceptions!"
Samuel Adams,And the world was normal and I was regularly playing music with other people
Samuel Adams,Not to say I peaked in high school but it still hasn't gotten back to that point because I don't have all the prospects lined up like I used to
Austin Medina,u need to meditate bro
Austin Medina,No Stranger To Sorrow sent an attachment.
Austin Medina,heres a good first car for samuel
Samuel Adams,For 2800? Nah it's a Dodge lmao
J Cole Patt,wheree rhe minecraft server

Samuel Adams,Adding a few cool mods to NB2 and seeing how it functions

Degan Nestrichal,"Listen cocksucker, right now I'm a click away from using an SQL injection attack to gain access to the database of this website and gain your login credentials, as well as your IP address onto my hacker forums, and then using an IP locator, I'll easily find your house and your name. With that I can access your social media accounts and proceed to ruin your life. You think I'm bluffing? You think that just because a bunch of 7 year old dipshits say they can ""hack"", but actually can't, that I can't either? Let me shatter that facade for you. Using my team of hackers, we can trace what websites you've visited and what keystrokes you've used, and with that, I can get into your parents' bank account. I can drain it and make you dirt poor.

Degan Nestrichal,eli 6 inches isnt even that big
J Cole Patt,Only 6? Rip
Elijah Parker,Lmao I'm not saying it is lad
Elijah Parker,Do you want me to get a ruler?
Elijah Parker,I'm kinda curious myself actually.
Degan Nestrichal,"its ok eli, the average has been going down, last time i checked its only 7.5"
Samuel Adams,"It's not about the size of the penis, it's who's attached at the other end â¤ï¸"
Elijah Parker,Nah like I'm genuinely curious hold up.
Elijah Parker,Lemme find a ruler lmao
J Cole Patt,Its nice to know that ur homie is 7.5 inches away connected tho right?
Samuel Adams,"The shorter the length, the closer your bodies can be â¤ï¸"
J Cole Patt,Imagine having a girl that cant take all of it.
J Cole Patt,rip
Degan Nestrichal,"yeah there have been a few girls who actually prefer 6 inch cocks believe it or not, like how some women prefer 5'2 men"
Samuel Adams,That won't matter when you're 90 and can't fuck without breaking a hip anyway
Degan Nestrichal,"thats so true, eli is just playing for the late game"
J Cole Patt,When you bust and she still suckin
Degan Nestrichal,fk what is austin doing here at 2:30AM
Elijah Parker,Bro once I said I like irish chicks and black girls I realized porn has advertised a chick with a heavy Irish accent and a thicc black girl more than anything lately.
Elijah Parker,Zucc sellin my info to porn sites.
J Cole Patt,Fuck hes at my house too!
Elijah Parker,Man I wish london was awake. :(:(:(:( Porn isn't doing it for me anymore.
Degan Nestrichal,fk austin dont crash against ur arch nemesis!
Elijah Parker,Fuck he's warping dimensions rn nigga
Elijah Parker,bout to go to the nether.
J Cole Patt,Man i didnt realize it but we live across from each other eddie
Samuel Adams,"Fuck, he just crashed with his japanese doppelanger Nitsua!"
J Cole Patt,His car disapearred!!!!
Samuel Adams,Leumas
Degan Nestrichal,J - eru
Samuel Adams,Hajile
Degan Nestrichal,Eidde
Degan Nestrichal,Zevahc
Samuel Adams,Odraude
Samuel Adams,Nhoj HpesoJ
Samuel Adams,Negad Lahcirtsen
Degan Nestrichal,Nani? Nitsua Blue 1997 Grand Cherokee go so fast!
Samuel Adams,Nitsua Oredroc Anidem
Samuel Adams,J Cole Eloc Ttap
Elijah Parker,A little over 6 and a half inches in length
Samuel Adams,The word bone was banned at a paleontology conference lmao
Elijah Parker,and an inch and like .75
Elijah Parker,For width
Elijah Parker,So p average but I'm happy with it ðð
Degan Nestrichal,"thats surprising that im not as far off as i thought, what is ur secret for taking dic pics eli?"
Samuel Adams,You're above average in length and about average in birth it would sound which ultimately means nothing because as long as you have a 4-7 incher you can satisfy 90% of women lmao
Elijah Parker,My secret?
Elijah Parker,I don't have a secret lad.
Samuel Adams,Never forget that the most sensitive part of the vagina is the first 3 inches and she's more interested in the emotional experience than anything
Elijah Parker,Oh dude lmao
Elijah Parker,So I found London's G-spot with a vibrator
Elijah Parker,That was a really fun night.
Elijah Parker,Happy laddie
Samuel Adams,I miss emotional intimacy the most probably
Elijah Parker,But no eddo what do you mean my secret lad? What did you think I was?
Elijah Parker,I like that one.
Degan Nestrichal,7-8
Samuel Adams,But getting a gf is too much work and I have too little to offer her atm
Elijah Parker,I'm not too far off from 7.
Elijah Parker,Maybe it was just the angle.
Elijah Parker,I just grab it and hold it with my thumb up against the side.
Samuel Adams,Life is about chasing women endlessly boys never fucking forget it!
Elijah Parker,That or I wasn't fully hard when I was measuring which is possible because a ruler on your cock fuckin hurts and I actually am 7.
Elijah Parker,Nah bro.
Elijah Parker,I'm pretty content with london rn honestly
Samuel Adams,That's good
Samuel Adams,Keep it up
Elijah Parker,I'll do my best
Elijah Parker,I'll be honest though I don't think it'll survive through job corps.
Samuel Adams,As long as you're honest with each other about that I don't see the problem
Samuel Adams,Make sure you've got balanced expectations so there's no undue heartache
Elijah Parker,I hope it does but the difference in commute and time and such. I just hope she'll like me enough to make it last
Elijah Parker,I grabada pp
Elijah Parker,I put it in a grapple lads
Samuel Adams,The commute or lack thereof is probably what killed my relationship with Rachel slowly more than anything
Elijah Parker,I just hope if it does come down to that that it'll end softly as well yk?
Samuel Adams,"Even if she claimed she couldn't put up with my family or something like that, the fact that we saw each other less once she transferred was probably a series of nails in the coffin"
Elijah Parker,Because she really is a cool lass.
Samuel Adams,You gotta get London and her friends and all of us together at least one more time so we can get drunk properly! We didn't do enough last time!
Elijah Parker,That's true man. I'm sorry dude. I'm sure we can find you a baddie if you'd like.
Elijah Parker,Okay so here's the full story.
Elijah Parker,"El doesn't mind ciggies, rachel does. The reason they left however was not actually you guys it was because El had to go to Michigan the next day to visit family."
Elijah Parker,I've been talking with her today and she's still actually in Michigan.
Elijah Parker,So y'all didn't do anything wrong in either of their eyes unless they aren't telling me the whole story.
Samuel Adams,I didn't have high expectations for continuing any conversation with the two of them so it's fine kek
Elijah Parker,But basically with them being 18 they're more of like.
Elijah Parker,Vape kids lmao.
Degan Nestrichal,2 type of men in this world
Elijah Parker,I came in just on the ass end of ciggie smoking apparently from looking at carthage.
Samuel Adams,Rachel seemed cool and el was distant but that corresponds to who took me off of snap the next day
Samuel Adams,"I made a fool of myself but I'm not embarrassed about it, I could've done a lot worse honestly lmao"
Elijah Parker,I'll try and get something set up. I haven't gotten a hold of Rachel but I've talked with London and El about it thusfar and it seems it was nothing you guys did. Like London said they found it funny.
Degan Nestrichal,they are just lying they hate sam
J Cole Patt,Kek
Elijah Parker,Oh fuck true! I forgot that small detail sam they hate your guts!!!
Degan Nestrichal,"sam was like ""dude i know im gonna regret having sex with u guys later"""
Samuel Adams,It's true they're sparing you the details because they know it'll get back to me kek
Elijah Parker,No he literally didn't say thst.
Degan Nestrichal,thats what he meant and the girls picked up on that! what a fucking horndog
J Cole Patt,Kek
Samuel Adams,I know some of these female machinations and it doesn't bother me in the slightest
Elijah Parker,Bro sam
Elijah Parker,I want to buy you a pocket pussy mate
Elijah Parker,For ur birthday
Elijah Parker,Does that sound like a plan stan
Samuel Adams,What if I've already found love by my birthday
J Cole Patt,xD
Samuel Adams,My birthday gift can be our completed cigar box guitars and our newfound love for craftsmanship
Elijah Parker,Okay then when I get my tax return lad.
Samuel Adams,No I definitely don't need a fleshlight but I'm flattered kek
Elijah Parker,LMFAO
Elijah Parker,Alright b no p
Samuel Adams,Save that money lad you need it for a new PC
Elijah Parker,Non
Samuel Adams,ðð»
Elijah Parker,I'll get a laptop for now.
Elijah Parker,All I'll really need it for is minecraft and TF2 lol
Samuel Adams,"That's what I did, I plan on transferring to a desktop setup in the future"
Samuel Adams,Not even transferring but additionally acquiring
Elijah Parker,I'd rather have a steady income before dropping over 1K on something that's just going to be collecting dust soon.
Samuel Adams,But then again I don't really need it right now
Samuel Adams,Exactly my point
Samuel Adams,I'll get a desktop and it'll spend most of the time off and unloved because I won't be home to use it
Elijah Parker,I'll just get a decent laptop for now until I get a good enough job and my own place until I get a laptop laddie
Elijah Parker,A laptop will probably be like. 350 or so too so it's cheaper and works for now
Samuel Adams,I still refuse to get any kind of dating app
Samuel Adams,Why should I lower myself to swiping on women
Elijah Parker,It's not that bad lad.
Elijah Parker,Just swipe every once in a while and wait for them to come in and then do it all over.
Elijah Parker,If you're not obsessively checking it you'll be fine :):):)
Elijah Parker,Especially since ur handsome and play guitar and are in marquette and about to get your own car in the summer and so on and so on lad.
Samuel Adams,I'd prefer to wait until I accomplish all of that
Samuel Adams,I learned from my last relationship that I'd much prefer to be earning some dough and driving before I step into the arena again
Elijah Parker,Well. That's up to you but you're already handsome and can play the guitar.
Samuel Adams,Even the handsome is debatable but I spent my teenage years harping on how I look and I'm over it kek
Samuel Adams,"That's another thing, I wanna get fit"
Elijah Parker,Stfu sam you're objectively good looking.
Samuel Adams,Guitar will always be a constant in my life regardless of everything else going on
Samuel Adams,I won't bore you with the exhaustive details of why I don't objectively believe that but it doesn't matter anyway
Elijah Parker,"You have a decent bone structure, clear skin, no deformities, no huge black bags under your eyes or pock marks all over the place, you're not covered in pizza acne and your face isn't set wrong in the slightest."
Elijah Parker,You're fine lad. You just need to stop looking for things to hate.
Samuel Adams,"It's all part of the self improvement process, I've just refined it to stop caring about things I can't change"
Elijah Parker,Sam. If you want my advice stop looking at it like that even.
Samuel Adams,I'm always gonna look the way I do so let's be the best version of ourselves instead of trying to be the best person period
Elijah Parker,Just look at what you've got right. Rather than something you wish you could change but can't.
Samuel Adams,"Well ya gotta understand Eli it's hard for me to be optimistic, I've never done well on blind faith alone"
Elijah Parker,I know laddie and I know I'm asking a lot at the same time I'm just trying to help and give you the perspective that helped me.
Samuel Adams,"Oh and I thank you for it, certainly, it's not lost on me"
Samuel Adams,I just have cognitive dissonance all over the fucking place and it all somehow comes together in a cohesive package lmao
Elijah Parker,I'm sorry if it came off as like aggressive or pushy or anything. I just drank a cat teapot full of some really relaxing herbal tea and meditated for a bit and I'm feeling chill as fuck tbh
Samuel Adams,Never apologize for coming off as pushy if it's something you truly believe brudder
Elijah Parker,That and I'm baked but that's probably obvious from the bong rips in the discord call lmfao
Elijah Parker,I think I'm going to bed now though. Y'all have a great night guys :):):)
Samuel Adams,"Good night Eli, I'm gonna pass out myself"
Elijah Parker,Have a good rest laddie. Catch ya tomorrow
Samuel Adams,I'm packing my bags and I've got my freedooom
Samuel Adams,I set up a limit sell for my silver stock
Samuel Adams,I pretty much bought it at the peak of its value and I'm hoping to only lose a dollar or so lmao
Austin Medina,You dont lose until you sell you could just hold lol
Degan Nestrichal,nah its going up at such a slow rate he wont even beat inflation
Austin Medina,Trust me
Austin Medina,U do not lose until u sell
Austin Medina,This is just facts
Samuel Adams,I'm not banking on a WSB bailout here lol
Austin Medina,"If youre losing money on a stock you like and understand just buy more at a good price and dollar cost average the price you paid down and then if it increases in value, it doesnt need to grow as much to turn a profit"
Austin Medina,"Oh yeah this is a bad example bc wsb, i forgot to tell you guys to sell slv and buy sndl"
Austin Medina,From now on if i get a good hunch about any trades ill suggest them
Degan Nestrichal,its money better invested elsewhere
Degan Nestrichal,god austin cant u see that isilver was a fucking sham? it was all a hoax and u fell for it!
Degan Nestrichal,You changed the group photo.
Degan Nestrichal,"i miss the old austin, stoned to the core austin, no money goal austin"

Samuel Adams,Nitsua-chan is such a bad driver!
Samuel Adams,"Apparently Mesa airlines is well positioned to get bigger boys, per a friend in Arizona who actively works on their planes lmao"

Samuel Adams,They posted a really good last quarter
Austin Medina,Ive been buying up dividend stocks to grow my passive income
Austin Medina,I should be damn near i think 75 dollar a year from dividend payments
J Cole Patt,"hey @Degan Nestrichal the test is like, 17 questions"

Degan Nestrichal,i wrote it in less than 3 hrs when it was open for 2 weeks
J Cole Patt,"I think you can habe it in your car, it just has to be unloaded."
Austin Medina,Prolly
Degan Nestrichal,"if i get an >80, then humanities is officially a joke"
Samuel Adams,"If you have a CCW license you can have it loaded and within reach, might just be WI though"
J Cole Patt,"Honestly once you become a criminal though, cops kinda go out the window."
J Cole Patt,Just shoot someone and drive off
J Cole Patt,No context
Austin Medina,Right
J Cole Patt,Just do it.
J Cole Patt,-Nike
Austin Medina,Yeah for sure
Austin Medina,"Sam would you like to learn to shoot, its actually pretty fun"
J Cole Patt,I can teach
Samuel Adams,Of course
J Cole Patt,What gun are you getting Austin?
Samuel Adams,It's an important skill to have in the American Wild
Austin Medina,Im thinking maybe a semi auto 12 gauge
Austin Medina,Not pump action
J Cole Patt,Rip good luck with jams
J Cole Patt,Altho
J Cole Patt,Hmmm
Elijah Parker,Saw off the barrel
Austin Medina,Thats illegal as fuck but it would be kinda sweg
J Cole Patt,How to make a legal gun a felony
J Cole Patt,Maybe one fo those russian guns
J Cole Patt,AK that shoots 12 gauge
Elijah Parker,A full auto is illegal as well.
J Cole Patt,Unless its a preban
Austin Medina,In some states
J Cole Patt,Or u got certain licenses.
Elijah Parker,As is brandishing it without a proper permit.
J Cole Patt,Theres still loopholes to it.
Austin Medina,I think in some southern states
Elijah Parker,Of course there is.
J Cole Patt,IK my dad was going on about it but it costs a fuck ton of money to do it.
Elijah Parker,But austin isn't planning on whipping out a sawn-off all the time now is he?
J Cole Patt,if ur going for self defense a 12 gauge is gucci tho
Austin Medina,"All i know is i like the feel of the 12 gauge, the particular one i had was ben franklins and his dad was showing us how to properly fire"
Samuel Adams,Open carry only idiots!
J Cole Patt,A 9mm is also a good pick. 45 is also better
Austin Medina,Cant legally obtain one till im 21 tho
Elijah Parker,I'm more of a 33 guy when it comes to handguns.
J Cole Patt,Citadels are by far my favorite handguns.
J Cole Patt,They smooth af and make no noise when ur handling the gun n such
J Cole Patt,"Unless you, shoot it then uh"
J Cole Patt,Gg
J Cole Patt,I had one of these for a bit but then had to give it back.
J Cole Patt,But by god it was super nice
Elijah Parker,My all time favorite gun is a FAMAS or an M60. I also like MP5s.
J Cole Patt,Ive always wanted to shoot a LMG
Elijah Parker,Me too. I like burst fire in rifles and SMGs but there's just something so fuckin cool about holding a hand held literal machine gun with a box full of ammo and a decent firing rate.
Elijah Parker,BARs are also fucking good looking imo.
Elijah Parker,But semi it's definitely the M1 Garand over any other mf gun.
J Cole Patt,ww2 lookin ass lmao

Elijah Parker,I like battle rifles lad

Elijah Parker,You can play for 6 hours and only feel like you played for 2.
Samuel Adams,Big Ass Temple for the Great American Youth!
Degan Nestrichal,just like terry envisioned
Degan Nestrichal,eli literally punching the air rn that he cant play on our dope modded server
Elijah Parker,Nah I'm about to video call with london's family.
Degan Nestrichal,lol interesting
Degan Nestrichal,is this what quarantine dating is like
Elijah Parker,No her family just live in Chicago lad
Elijah Parker,And 2/3rds of the family we are calling are old people lol
Degan Nestrichal,lol good luck mate u are gonna not need it tho mate
Samuel Adams,At this pace you'll be married by June
Elijah Parker,We got this sweater at goodwill yesterday.
Elijah Parker,I like it a lot.
Elijah Parker,It's like a really pale yellow that matches the really pale yellow on my vans :):):):):):)
Samuel Adams,LFG
Samuel Adams,"@Degan Nestrichal I have such a hard time picking up the proper rhythm of Them Bones when I try to play along to it, it's like the riff skips a beat"
Degan Nestrichal,now that i listen to it again i might hear it or maybe its a placebo lol
Samuel Adams,It's a lot more pronounced without Layne's vocals
Samuel Adams,He ties the song together so to speak
Degan Nestrichal,idk how to describe music over text but i think i hear it
Samuel Adams,"LIke, he starts the riff on the 1 and it stays pretty consistent until the 2nd beat where it seems to do a stutter or some kind"
Austin Medina,Sounds like a polyrhythm to me lemme look up the riff
Austin Medina,Could be polymeter too
Samuel Adams,Actually I think it's polymeter
Samuel Adams,Now that I hear the isolated guitar track it sound like he's playing the riff 3/4 and it starts on the 4 of every drum beat
Austin Medina,Or well its in 7/8
Samuel Adams,I think I was trying to play it as 4/4 and getting confused lmao
Austin Medina,Yeah its in 7/8 tho not 3/4 so that would be an 8th note off no?
Samuel Adams,Yeah which would make sense considering the jumpiness of the riff
Austin Medina,It seems like its not even polymeter because to me its just in 7/8 time so the riff and drums both start over at each bar
Austin Medina,It also sounds like the 2nd snare on each bar sounds slightly swung or syncopated but it could be placebo as well
Austin Medina,this stupid mf nearly fucking hit me in my honda bro smfh
Austin Medina,"i was just driving straight past a gas station and this dude in a piece of shit rusty buick pulls out and nearly hits me, i swerve to avoid him and he just kept fucking going"
Austin Medina,i think if i was in my jeep i mightve pulled a uturn to talk some shit but i dont have the insurance on the honda lmfao
Austin Medina,sam dont drive without insurance
Austin Medina,it is spoonky
Elijah Parker,here's a spoonkey
Austin Medina,spoonky
Elijah Parker,FUCK
Elijah Parker,sam you've seen a cursed image I don't wish to be spread mate.
Austin Medina,pretty sure sam left his messenger app open while hes doing something he has been instantly seeing messages but not responding
Elijah Parker,Alright good.
Elijah Parker,That image isn't meant for human eyes mate
Samuel Adams,Hey babes
Samuel Adams,Austin was indeed correct
Elijah Parker,Hi sam
Elijah Parker,You wanna see a funny image lad
Samuel Adams,Yes
Austin Medina,did u see my message about nearly getting hit
Samuel Adams,I did
Samuel Adams,Tell him you work at Anthony Buick GMC and you found the meth stash while working on his beater
Austin Medina,that shit was probably a new close for nearly being hit
Austin Medina,i keep a big ole metal pipe in my car i could just throw it as his piece of shit car
Austin Medina,prolly wouldnt care
Elijah Parker,Bro you would lose ur pipe tho.
Austin Medina,worth
Elijah Parker,Austin when thinking about all the happy memories he has with that pipe after throwing it.
Austin Medina,Im so excited for the weather to warm up
Austin Medina,It should be like 40 tuesday
Elijah Parker,"lmao ""warm"""
Austin Medina,warmish
J Cole Patt,would it b cool if my mom played minecraft with us?

Elijah Parker,Lol is that colt?
Elijah Parker,Or Cole or whatever it was.
Austin Medina,Bro driving the honda really gets my heart pumping driving stick is so engaging lmaoo
Samuel Adams,That was indeed Colt
Elijah Parker,I wonder what ever happened to that guy.
Elijah Parker,The last time I ever saw him he was crying in the hallway but wouldn't explain why.
J Cole Patt,rip
J Cole Patt,Sem
J Cole Patt,Join the gay
Degan Nestrichal,suzuki master race
J Cole Patt,whats going good?

J Cole Patt,Why are you up late?
Degan Nestrichal,"yes why are you guys up so late, please go to bed!"
Austin Medina,Ive had about enough of this fucking cat
J Cole Patt,looks like my dads old car
Austin Medina,it is old as fuck so
Austin Medina,Damn this nigga plays better than eddie
Samuel Adams,Now just sample it and you can get a cover of him playing whiplash
Samuel Adams,Vestralis had 13 views last night which one of you FUCKS are spamming the deprecated band page
Degan Nestrichal,no one was spamming it the band just boutta take off
Samuel Adams,I'd laugh if I logged into distrokid and had hundreds of dollars waiting for me
Samuel Adams,Repost this every time I get absolutely drywalled
Samuel Adams,Yes
Degan Nestrichal,occasionally 1125 lbs
Samuel Adams,You will never not be lifting
Degan Nestrichal,reach frequently 3466%
Samuel Adams,"Cops be like ""Kneel occasionally 133%"""
Degan Nestrichal,drive frequently 2-4 hrs
Degan Nestrichal,did some HR rep for this company just get stoned and make a job listing
Degan Nestrichal,lemme see if their job listings are still this goofy lmao
Degan Nestrichal,she forgot the hyphens it appears
Samuel Adams,You still have to drive frequently 2-4 hours
Degan Nestrichal,lmao its a job listing for a retail clerk
Degan Nestrichal,how lazy as an HR person can u be
Samuel Adams,"Lmao double double toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble! These are nursery rhymes what weak shit xd"
Degan Nestrichal,@J Cole Patt u want a cool mechanical keyboard for $50? it lights up and is so swag :oooo
J Cole Patt,Maybe nit
Elijah Parker,London just went home :(:(
Elijah Parker,who are these cute little lesbians and how tight are their individual pussies?
Samuel Adams,How did he get under the rail
Samuel Adams,Is that just an illusion
Austin Medina,I think it's an illusion
Austin Medina,Jojo siwa x da baby collaboration in the works?
Samuel Adams,Can't wait for Jojo Baby to drop
Samuel Adams,It's gonna be the new Love Sosa
Austin Medina,How are you semuwell
Samuel Adams,Pretty good
Samuel Adams,Just woke up a few min ago because I stayed up all night like a chad
Austin Medina,Nice bro
Austin Medina,"I wanna live like that again, but only for a few nights"
Samuel Adams,You can always make time for a good time
Austin Medina,Hell yeah
Austin Medina,I got my tax return i put 2100 straight into savings
Samuel Adams,Good shit
Austin Medina,Got 2288 total so im gonna put the rest towards saving for a gun
Austin Medina,Might just have my parents buy me a pistol and transfer it to me
Samuel Adams,I got 1800 from my boys at Marquette because of Papa Joey's funding
Austin Medina,Papa joe is a nigra
Samuel Adams,My parents are borrowing like half of it until the end of the month and/or my dad's case gets settled but we should be sitting pretty in a month or so if all goes well
Samuel Adams,"Things are lookin up, life is good"
Austin Medina,"Cant count on too much tho, i would try to save that moneu"
Austin Medina,I was supposed to get more but i forgot to declare my realized stock gains and they deducted that
Samuel Adams,"I mean I'm at the point right now where I could easily blow 1800 in one sitting on a car or something, so I don't know how long this chunk of change would last anyway"
Austin Medina,"Im just gonna try to save like 9-10k a year and ill be set by the time im 22-23, hopefully ill have a decent job by then too"
Samuel Adams,The unfortunate thing is that rent is so goddamn atrocious that you're almost forced to mortgage a home just to pay for it
Austin Medina,"Im gonna buy a house anyway, renting is just a cycle"
Samuel Adams,"And then creditors will tell you ""We don't think you're capable of paying a 300/month mortgage so we'll leave you out to dry with 1k a month rent"""
Austin Medina,I wanna be able to actually own it when im said and done
Austin Medina,Its*
Samuel Adams,The system is absolutely busted at every level and it's maddening
Austin Medina,"Well its much more than just mortgage, u got insurance, utilities, maintenance, unexpected costs up the wazoo, plus lenders insurance sometimes"
Samuel Adams,Yeah but you can get that all tied up into your insurance via escrow
Austin Medina,Youre really responsible for all that shit so thats part of the cost of rent is just not dealing with that bs
Samuel Adams,Or house payment I should say
Samuel Adams,The cost of rent is also potentially dealing with a PoS landlord who doesn't care and then you're worse off either way
Austin Medina,"Yeah but its still expensive as fuck, i wanna get a high downpayment on a cheaper first house and try to pay it off relatively quick while still living there and then maybe rent it if i can get my shit straight"
Austin Medina,Tru
Samuel Adams,You reckon you could pay down your house in 10 years?
Samuel Adams,In other news I somehow sold my SLV at $26
Samuel Adams,Recouped all but a dollar and 70 cents
Austin Medina,"Depends, if its a 70k loan on a 100k house you gotta take into account all that bs plus the cost of the interest so you would have to pay quite a bit a year to make it work"
Austin Medina,Dont lose till u sell
Austin Medina,Im down on tesla and nio but im holding
J Cole Patt,Stock market be gay
Samuel Adams,I bought SLV at the absolute worst spot and it's not going to grow
Samuel Adams,"At least, not fast enough for my liking"
Samuel Adams,"But yeah, I've been working with amortization schedules lately and it's pretty interesting stuff"
Austin Medina,Imma buy a handgun
Samuel Adams,You can pay off a house way quicker if you pay even 100 dollars over the monthly payment
Austin Medina,I would probably try to go hard and pay that shit off as fast as possible
Austin Medina,In a perfect world that is
Samuel Adams,"Sometimes you can opt to pay off principal only which is pretty stacked, then you don't incur any further interest"
Austin Medina,Ah shit
Austin Medina,at that point you could pay it off however slowly you want?
Samuel Adams,"Well, actually, nvm, that's a different kind of loan I think"
Samuel Adams,You're always gonna get interest on interest because it continuously compounds
Austin Medina,Yea
Samuel Adams,"I think at that point it doesn't matter how much you pay, just that you pay it sooner"
Austin Medina,Why dont you just be a real estate agent
Samuel Adams,I've thought about my second major being real estate
Samuel Adams,It's a field that fascinates me for sure and I've always said the only real valuable thing is land kek
J Cole Patt,i could be asleep right now but they have me doing their stupid shit for them.
Austin Medina,Whom
J Cole Patt,The fam
Austin Medina,Gotta love em
J Cole Patt,ð¡ð¡
J Cole Patt,So fkn tired
J Cole Patt,This shit is fucjin stupid.
Austin Medina,What exactly are u doing
Samuel Adams,"He is listening to Uprising by Muse, off of the album The Resistance (2009)"
J Cole Patt,Depositing monry to the bani.
J Cole Patt,Bank
Austin Medina,I see
Austin Medina,Isnt it fucked how all these international mega companies pretend to care about minority communities to get people to buy their shit and no one bats an eye and just pretends they rly care
Samuel Adams,"If the establishment is on the side of your protest, are you really even protesting xd"
Austin Medina,I dont even think theyre on their side theyre just taking their chance to make money
Austin Medina,So anyone tryna do some shit this weekend
Samuel Adams,Perhappenstance
Samuel Adams,I'll be back in town on an official basis this weekend for mi sister's birthday
J Cole Patt,ay
Austin Medina,What days u gon be busy dawg
Samuel Adams,Not sure yet
Austin Medina,K just let us know neebus
Elijah Parker,I'll probably be free too.
Elijah Parker,London doesn't have class Saturday or sunday.
Elijah Parker,I'm gonna spend the night in her dorm.
Samuel Adams,How do you keep sneaking in lmao
J Cole Patt,its ez af
Samuel Adams,It must not be as hard as getting into a Marquette dorm
J Cole Patt,U just gotta act like u live there.
Elijah Parker,I'm surprisingly light footed when I need to be as well.
Samuel Adams,Yeah that doesn't work here
Elijah Parker,Like for going down the stairs to take a piss.
Elijah Parker,"But basically what the general idea is I carry something that I would reasonably need two hands to carry like a pack of water or her overnight bag, she scans her card to get into the buildings and I make sure the people at the front desks see me use both hands and look like I'm struggling."
Elijah Parker,Then when I go take a piss at night I just be super quiet and wear my carthage shirt and shorts so even if someone does see me they assume I belong there.
Samuel Adams,This dude is a certified Redman
Elijah Parker,I've got a science to my ways boyos. I can blend in anywhere. ð
Samuel Adams,See at Marquette you'd have to scan in no matter what and atm you can't scan in people from outside school or other dorms even
Samuel Adams,But we're fine enough to take in person classes together and eat at the same places amirite
Elijah Parker,But see sammy.
Elijah Parker,If my hands are full and I'm wearing marquette merch all I've gotta do is put my hood up and logically they should be cool with you scanning for me.
Elijah Parker,Like I'll already be incognitoish with the hood but I already fit in with the college demographic and I highly doubt they would know everyone in your dorms with their hoods up and a mask on.
Samuel Adams,The thing is you're not supposed to be allowed into the dorms without scanning in
Samuel Adams,You really have to sneak in not just blend in
Elijah Parker,"All I gotta do is be like ""thank you so much for helping me scan in"" or some shit to you"
Austin Medina,We gotta take some road trips this summer guys
Elijah Parker,Well if that's the case ð
Elijah Parker,Gonna find a way sammy don't worry.
Samuel Adams,I have snuck in precisely one person and that was only because we knew the DR wasn't actively watching the screen of who scanned in and I scanned in immediately after
Elijah Parker,Exactly boyo
Elijah Parker,That's one of the ways we could do it.
Elijah Parker,Or I could find a side door or a back exit or something sammy.
Samuel Adams,"The dorms are designed in such a way that there's only one access point to the residential spaces and if they have to have another one, they have someone posted there"
Elijah Parker,Or I could even make friends with someone on the first floor and have them sneak me in through the window.
Samuel Adams,That's just a Milwaukee thing though because we go to school in the middle of a city
Elijah Parker,There's ways buddy. I'll always find a way to be somewhere I'm not supposed to be for the lads and the lovely London ð
Samuel Adams,Don't want weirdos sneaking into the dorms unaccounted for
Elijah Parker,Exactly but like I said.
Elijah Parker,First floor window method works.
Samuel Adams,Unfortunately my dorm doesn't have rooms until the third floor lmao
Elijah Parker,Then I'll climb up to the 3rd floor in the middle of the night lad ð
Samuel Adams,"And they've thought of this too because the windows aren't designed to be opened all the way, just cracked for air flow"
Elijah Parker,Hmmm. They're serious then.
Elijah Parker,How tall is the building?
Samuel Adams,"Fairly tall, I live on the top floor"
Elijah Parker,How many floors laddie.
Samuel Adams,7
Elijah Parker,Is there any other buildings near by?
Elijah Parker,That are like. 4 or so?
Samuel Adams,There's a church across the street which I climbed up once
Elijah Parker,Ayyyy that was my idea.
Samuel Adams,"But there's nowhere you could like jump onto mashuda, it's not connected to other buildings like that"
Elijah Parker,I was thinking getting to the tallest building next to it and trying a grappling hook maybe.
Elijah Parker,FUCK
Elijah Parker,They're serious about their protection bro.
Samuel Adams,Like I said a lot of this is pre-COVID and is just a result of urban living
Samuel Adams,Carthage is a little more out of the way comparatively
Elijah Parker,The best way I could think of is going when the dorms are super busy and just trying to blend in as best as possible.
Elijah Parker,Like do you need to scan for the door or for a secretary is the biggest thing.
Samuel Adams,That's what audino did first day of school but they caught into that as well and started posting more security guards at dorms that were being snuck into
Elijah Parker,God damn bro they got your asses like prisoners.
Elijah Parker,I can only imagine how they do schools in chicago if they're that serious about Milwaukee
J Cole Patt,Milwaukee is super liberal
J Cole Patt,Over at Carthage they give no fucks tbh
J Cole Patt,God will save them <3
Elijah Parker,Carthage be easy but apparently they're also hella racist.
J Cole Patt,ye
Elijah Parker,London is actually moving colleges at the end of the year.
Elijah Parker,She's going to Illinois State University.
J Cole Patt,O shit
J Cole Patt,Im prolly going there
J Cole Patt,wait
Elijah Parker,You living on campus?
J Cole Patt,shes from chicago right?
J Cole Patt,Nah
J Cole Patt,Im prolly thinking of NIU
Elijah Parker,Yeah she's from Chicago.
Samuel Adams,ISU is in central Illinois rip
Elijah Parker,Yeah that's true. I've gotta go to milwaukee as well.
Elijah Parker,I was thinking every once in a while on the weekends I'm home taking the train to chicago and having her meet me at the train station.
Elijah Parker,Then video calling and whatever.
Samuel Adams,Whatever works for the two of you lad
Austin Medina,Niggas fight on the hill
Samuel Adams,Why? They do not know!
Elijah Parker,Here's a door
Samuel Adams,Here's Drake
Elijah Parker,He's like a door
Elijah Parker,That motherfucker
Elijah Parker,He took my style of sweatpants and flannel shirts
Elijah Parker,I'm going to hunt him down and burn his flannels.
Elijah Parker,Sam.
Elijah Parker,SAM
Elijah Parker,This is very important.
Elijah Parker,Did he also wear running shoes with that fuckin outfit?
Samuel Adams,From what I remember Drake would always wear oversized converse
Samuel Adams,Giving the effect of clown shoes
Elijah Parker,Alright good.
Elijah Parker,I can't believe this sammy.
Samuel Adams,We had a type for our drummers <3
Elijah Parker,Speakin o which.
Elijah Parker,After I learn the guitar (more than likely during job Corps)
Elijah Parker,I'd be down to actually learn the drums.
Samuel Adams,Fuck yeah
Samuel Adams,Is this the band we've always meant to have
Austin Medina,We need to find a fuckin legit drummer bro FUCK i wanna rock
Samuel Adams,Yeah Eli if you want to learn the drums I can really only teach you the basics I'm not that good myslf
Elijah Parker,I'd like to learn guitar first because of because I can take that with me during my time at job Corps.
Samuel Adams,It takes a very special kind of dedication to be a good drummer I feel
Austin Medina,We could jam on not so pretty this weekend bro that would be really fun
Samuel Adams,"In comparison, guitar is piss easy but maybe that's because I've played guitar consistently for 5 years"
Austin Medina,Convince your parents to let us play in the basement
Samuel Adams,Fuck that would be swell I'll ask
Austin Medina,Guitar is very hard to play in terms of technicality but yeah weve been playing so long its become easy
Elijah Parker,I'll have to get a laptop so I can easily video call you guys so you can teach me guitar if you'd like.
Samuel Adams,"Nothing beats the in person experience I feel, it's just a lot easier to get things across"
Elijah Parker,That's true but better over video calls and sometimes in person on the weekends than learning blindly yk?
Samuel Adams,That's true
Austin Medina,Learning in person is great bro
Elijah Parker,I mean I could also just get a stand for my phone.
Elijah Parker,Oh yeah I agree but I'd have to live on campus up in milwaukee.
Samuel Adams,I never took a single lesson and it probably took me a bit longer to catch up to where I should be technically
Elijah Parker,So I mean video calls and then learning in person on the weekends when I'm free is a lot easier.
Samuel Adams,If I went back and did it again I'd probably bite the bullet and learn stuff sooner so I could capitalize on my music abilities sooner
Elijah Parker,What's stopping you now though laddie?
Elijah Parker,Have you ever sent a demo to a record label?
Samuel Adams,Record labels are the devil
Elijah Parker,That's true actually.
Samuel Adams,I technically run my own record label funnily enough lmao
Elijah Parker,bro you're like hopsin with Funk Volume.
Elijah Parker,bro fuck you're gonna get hella bitches bro fuck!!!!!!
Samuel Adams,I was actually talking to a guy who I'm gonna be living with next year named Daniel and asking if he wanted to be releasing his music through Vestral Records
Samuel Adams,"He does acoustic stuff which I like a lot, I'd like to be his producer if he ever decides to do a big musical project"
Elijah Parker,Oh shit hell yeah look at you ððð
Elijah Parker,Sam.
Elijah Parker,If I get good at the blues will you sign a nigga ð«ð«ð«
Austin Medina,If i was more consistent i could be much better i need to be better bro
Samuel Adams,The business side of things is really a meme until further notice
Samuel Adams,There's no contracts to negotiate here because we're not generating any money lmao
Elijah Parker,I want a 15 percent stake.
Elijah Parker,Lmfao
Elijah Parker,I'm just joking btw
Samuel Adams,And being indie allows you to do this because otherwise the record label usually lops off like 60% off the top and then you have to pay so many fuckin people down the line to the point where the artist maybe gets 5% of all earnings
Elijah Parker,But no I'd love to help if you need it.
Elijah Parker,I don't have a business degree but I'm Jewish so it's close enough.
Samuel Adams,"And imagine if you split that four/five ways, yall are making literally pennies on the dollar"
Elijah Parker,Bro
Samuel Adams,The great thing is that the internet is our greatest tool for free self-promotion and release
Elijah Parker,Imagine how much mf money someone like Justin bieber or whatever would actually be worth then.
Samuel Adams,There's no barriers to entry like there used to be in the music industry
Samuel Adams,"If Bieber was making all of the money from all of his releases, he'd be worth hundreds of millions of dollars no cap"
Elijah Parker,He's making hundreds of millions already.
Elijah Parker,He's worth 285 mil bro
Samuel Adams,In that case this fuckin guy would probably be a billionaire
Samuel Adams,"But we do have to remember it's possible most of his money doesn't come from music, could be endorsements"
Elijah Parker,Probably even multi billionaire at 26 bro
Samuel Adams,"Once athletes retire and they can't be paid to play football anymore, they continue to be profitable by selling their image instead"
Samuel Adams,Not sure JB has a well-defined image to sell but that's that
Elijah Parker,Imagine that bro.
Elijah Parker,Like.
Elijah Parker,If I made like.
Elijah Parker,10 mil a year.
Samuel Adams,"Usually what artists do in that case is draw up the capital to market themselves, like Rihanna has made fucking bank because she pioneered her own brand called Fenty"
Elijah Parker,I'd play for max like 3 years and then dip
Elijah Parker,I'm not trying to get fucked up or have paparazzi in my face all the time.
Elijah Parker,And 30 mil is waaaaaaay more than enough to live comfortably.
Samuel Adams,"Probably the best course of action honestly, there's a lot of nasty injuries that can punish you for a lifetime especially in football"
Elijah Parker,Exactly bro.
Elijah Parker,Idk man. I don't really like sports either. Even if I did though I'd do that and like join a minor league team or something.
Elijah Parker,Something I wouldn't get completely fucked playing more than likely and also won't have to deal with people basically stalking me all the time.
Samuel Adams,"Funny thing is, guys who don't ever see a single snap and are lifelong benchwarmers are still paid a livable wage in most sports"
Elijah Parker,That's even better bro.
Elijah Parker,But at the same time.
Elijah Parker,Like I don't like sports lmao.
Samuel Adams,There's a lot of parallels between sport and music
Elijah Parker,"I'd rather play for a few years, make crazy money and then dip than sit and have to watch it and make like. 30k a year."
Samuel Adams,A performance is almost like a sports game and musicians are easily the most competitive of the artsy types
Elijah Parker,I mean music too. If I had a chance to be famous I'd make music for like 5 years then stop.
Elijah Parker,At least publicly.
Samuel Adams,That's only if you treat music like a job
Samuel Adams,"For me, it's a lifelong pursuit"
Samuel Adams,Something very very big would have to fill the immense void that would be left behind if I didn't play music
Elijah Parker,I'd still make music or play music but I wouldn't release it to the masses yk? People are fucking insane when it comes to celebrities bro I don't want to deal with that.
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, I get that"
Elijah Parker,That's my main thing
Samuel Adams,Sia is an example of an artist who deliberately obscures her face and shit 1. as a gimmick and 2. as a way to avoid being recognized in public because of aforementioned crazies
Elijah Parker,I'd do something like that maybe yeah.
Elijah Parker,Like a mask or something.
Elijah Parker,But then there's the issue of what if I fucked up along the line?
Samuel Adams,I wouldn't mind dealing with crazies honestly
Samuel Adams,"If I get killed by a crazy fan, big deal, that adds to the mythos kek"
Elijah Parker,Like what if I pissed someone off so bad they'd reveal my identity yk?
Samuel Adams,Just look at John Lennon
Elijah Parker,Like a girlfriend or whatever.
Samuel Adams,"People are gonna know your identity in the long run anyway, like Tobias Forge from Ghost"
Elijah Parker,Exactly why I shouldn't be in the public eye.
Samuel Adams,"For about 4 years he kept it mostly under wraps but people were always suspicious that it was him, and then he just rolled with it and separated his public persona from his stage persona"
Elijah Parker,I'm stressed enough without having to deal with crazy mfs
Samuel Adams,"When you're in that business you have to take a measured stance of distance from people, it's true"
Samuel Adams,"Like James Hetfield from Metallica refuses to do pictures with people just because he knows if you give one picture, the implication is that everyone gets a picture"
Elijah Parker,I'd go play in a coffee shop or for my lads or maybe a lass if I'm married or whatever but idk I'd dip from having the possibility of anyone in the world listening to my music.
Elijah Parker,Exactly.
Elijah Parker,Like it's not personal but I don't want to be stalked by some insane person that thinks I scorned them by not taking a picture with them or something.
Samuel Adams,But these are the same guys who claim that even though you get surrounded by crazies you also occasionally make heartwarming interactions because I've seen the meet and greets where people literally break down because the music saved their life
Samuel Adams,"Or was how they learned English, was how they met their spouse, was their dad's favorite band, the list goes on"
Elijah Parker,"Be incognito, release for a few years under an alias and a mask if it's a show, then vamaos amigo I'm not letting everyone see this anymore."
Elijah Parker,But that's the thing sam.
Samuel Adams,"That's why I welcome the prospect of writing music that gets widely recognized because I want to write with some greater purpose that maybe I could help someone who's been down in the dumps like I have, in the same headspace that caused me to write those songs"
Elijah Parker,It's not a matter of like. Something like that it's more the matter of a crazy mf.
Samuel Adams,"Not to say all of my songs are sad, for sure"
Elijah Parker,I'd still interact with people. Just not in person.
Samuel Adams,J you gotta send us your location bro don't get murked lmao
Elijah Parker,I could never imagine being as famous as someone like Justin bieber though.
Samuel Adams,"If you ever want a good insight into a musician's mind Eli, I'd recommend watching Billy Corgan's episode on the joe rogan experience"
Samuel Adams,He probably explains it way better than I can because he's actually walked the walk
Elijah Parker,If I'm a star I'd rather have it get big and blow up than stay being big yk? People are weird individuals. Like I understand wanting to interact with a musician but people also forget that they are people too.
Samuel Adams,"Absolutely, I've never understood the cult of personality around celebrities in general but I think people cling to things that they don't have in their personal life"
Samuel Adams,"It's a weird psychoanalytic thing, kind of like celebrity adoration is another coping mechanism"
Elijah Parker,Like I don't want to sound like an asshole but I'm not a robot that can interact with every single fan at every single second of every single day and trust thst every single one of them isn't a pyscho that's gonna try and gut me or some shit.
Elijah Parker,And I mean doing that for years and years and years is too much yk?
Elijah Parker,That's the kind of thing that would burn me out from music.
Samuel Adams,That's the reason the Beatles stopped performing live and became a studio band in 1966 I believe
Samuel Adams,"There was such a ridiculous hysteria around them that it actually wasn't enjoyable anymore, they wanted to get back to what they loved which was writing music"
Elijah Parker,I'd probably just be a studio act in general actually.
J Cole Patt,"Goodbye, My Darling! sent a live location."
Samuel Adams,I will say there is no feeling quite like playing music live
Elijah Parker,Stay completely incognito and release music so that way I wouldn't need to worry about crazy fans at all.
J Cole Patt,i will b getting merked
Samuel Adams,Man you're really out there lmao
Samuel Adams,Going to lake geneva lookin ass
Elijah Parker,Nigga why are you in Salem lakes?
J Cole Patt,gotta do sum stuff
Samuel Adams,"But yeah, I can't stress enough that no matter how crazy things might be, there is such a thrill in playing for other people and i can still watch the old videos from my concerts at st joes and they make me happy"
Elijah Parker,bro just like the people of Illinois. Always going to Lake Geneva smfh
Samuel Adams,I've always been a performer to the point of being obnoxious lmao

Degan Nestrichal,austin studying to become an oppressive dictator in the future

Austin Medina,"Im down so bad in the stonks today, evs are struggling"
Samuel Adams,You don't lose til you sell ð¥´
Austin Medina,"I know, im buying more tomorrow depending on price"
Samuel Adams,Electric vehicles are certainly promising for the future but I don't think the states are at all equipped to deal with millions more of them any time soon lmao
Austin Medina,Invest in the companies partnering to develope their infrastructure then hell ye
Austin Medina,Ive been thinking about that i need to do some research
Austin Medina,"Today has been fucking insane, its warm so ive washed probably 20-30 cars in 5 hours"
Samuel Adams,"Actually that's big dick intuition, I didn't even think of that"
Samuel Adams,The infrastructure will have to grow out of necessity
Austin Medina,Itll be a more complicated process than we think for sure but i think thats a good place to starr
Austin Medina,Start*
Samuel Adams,The biggest barrier to entry I've come across in my nascent financial career is that it's so hard to actually figure out which companies are going to take off with the concepts you think will be profitable in the future
Samuel Adams,Sears might have pioneered the department store but competitors obviously did far better than them and it shows
Austin Medina,"I have some faith in the us manufacturers, mainly ford and gm"
Austin Medina,"Yeah i mean idk i trust tesla long term, but gm just has so much more influence and history with the us consumers"
Austin Medina,"Most people that will be 60 in 20 years arent going to go and buy teslas, theyll probably keep buying whatever theyve been buying for 40 years"
Austin Medina,Althought it would be cool to see some boomers buying teslas
Samuel Adams,Aren't people who are 40 right now right on the cusp of the Gen X/Millennial divide
Samuel Adams,Kinda depends on how old their parents are I suppose
Austin Medina,"I suppose thats true, i consider them boomers because theyre old ð"
Samuel Adams,I know 30 year olds are firmly millennials and 50 year olds are firmly gen xers and there's a big shift between the two
Samuel Adams,"I wanna say new entries to the market are going to become a bigger part of automobiles in particular, because of disappointments across the board as far as planned obsolescense goes"
Degan Nestrichal,silver is the worst investment ive ever made fkin stoopid austin
Austin Medina,I told u to sell

Degan Nestrichal,no austin said im not gonna lose until i sell!
Austin Medina,"I havent been investing all too much recently, i put 150 bucks in for tomorrow ill most likely buy nio i like the price its at"
Degan Nestrichal,even tho he sold! why dont u practice what u preach austin? cunt!
Austin Medina,This is true u could hold it until it goes up
Samuel Adams,Wish I could've caught onto Fantom
Samuel Adams,It was 0.01 a month ago and is now 43 cents
Austin Medina,Actually nio recovered well see what i do with the 150 tomorrow
Austin Medina,Man i couldve gotten nio at like 40 bucks earlier this morning thats a big dip to buy into
Austin Medina,I remember when robinhood let you trade your money before it actually hit the account
Austin Medina,Now you gotta wait like a day
Samuel Adams,"muh ""good faith violation"""
Samuel Adams,Fidelity does the same thing
Austin Medina,It hasnt been around for non paying accounts for a good while
Austin Medina,"Ill probably move my investments into a more serious account eventually, robinhood is kind of low level"
Degan Nestrichal,tesla was down to 620 this morning
Degan Nestrichal,i bought 2 shares of AMD austin ride the AMD train
Samuel Adams,"I only own stock in smith and wesson, murica"
Samuel Adams,Is this shit really gonna cost 33 bucks a month lmao
Samuel Adams,You're gonna run through your credits pretty quickly
Samuel Adams,Da moon
Austin Medina,What costs 33 a month?
Elijah Parker,Da moon
Degan Nestrichal,"the forecast is always off, i started 3 instances testing stuff out so that automatically is gonna drive it up. Also im realistic and know the server wont last forever, if u guys wanna chip in like $5-8 a month thatd be dandy"
Samuel Adams,Bet I'll pay 10 bucks for donor privileges which means I get a chest full of 1000 tnt â¤ï¸
Degan Nestrichal,yes donor privileges means an entire double chest of tnt
Degan Nestrichal,super donor privileges means complete dictation over the server with op
Degan Nestrichal,im doing alright financially tho i got a loooooot of financial aid and have basically only been spending on groceries and alcohol xD
Samuel Adams,Good shit
Degan Nestrichal,also im considering moving hosts to vultr but ill have to see
Samuel Adams,Marquette sent me an extra bit of cash yesterday as part of papa joe emergency grant moneies
Degan Nestrichal,i got that too today
Samuel Adams,Now if only school could close so I could get 3k from the room and board I didn't use ð
Samuel Adams,When all's said and done I should have 2k to do whatever with i believe
Austin Medina,Save it
Degan Nestrichal,lmao austin is missing out on all this goverment handout money cuz hes a NE!
Austin Medina,I got my stimmy money
Austin Medina,Got 2300 in my tax return instead of 500
Austin Medina,Im saving it all
Degan Nestrichal,u mean ur investing it in tesla
Austin Medina,I'm going to put either 150 in the Tesla or nio
Austin Medina,I need more money for a Honda S2000
Degan Nestrichal,austin why u got a 0 car garage but u already have 3 cars?
Austin Medina,Niggas be poor
Elijah Parker,So yes let's get another car

Samuel Adams,His revving his engine in another girl's garage
Austin Medina,We can rent a car and go brazy
Austin Medina,Theres a rental agency that works out of my dealership
Degan Nestrichal,rev ur engine in a garage austin it hit diff
Degan Nestrichal,then proceed to walk out!
Degan Nestrichal,and bask in the glory for a few minutes
Austin Medina,"I wanna make plans with u guys and do some crazy shit this summer, its the only time of year thats nice enough to do shit"
Degan Nestrichal,yes rev engine in car garage and proceed to walk out and bask in its glory
Degan Nestrichal,i deleted the minecraft server ð¥º
Degan Nestrichal,and got a new one on vultr xd
Samuel Adams,Fuck did you save the world file lmao
Degan Nestrichal,indeed
Samuel Adams,Excellent
Degan Nestrichal,45.76.227.245
Degan Nestrichal,"vultr is more transparent with their billing so it makes more sense, on google its just like wellllll it could cost this much.."
Degan Nestrichal,also the IP address should stay the same
Degan Nestrichal,although not entirely sure
Degan Nestrichal,we just gotta keep relaying promotional credits from one cloud hosting service to another to ensure we dont contribute any money to the corporate overlords that rule the economy!
Samuel Adams,This would be sun in the sky/rotting alive if I made a song out of it
Degan Nestrichal,ketchup is sweet tomato sauce
Degan Nestrichal,idiot
Degan Nestrichal,paste would mean its close to a tomato but its just chemically produced tomato sauce/marinade!
Degan Nestrichal,boutta take a picture of granite in minecraft and be like here mf xD
Samuel Adams,Eddie what did you think of that monstrous fucking RIFF
J Cole Patt,lmao
Samuel Adams,"That is a mineral, because it is heavy as fuck"
J Cole Patt,Just sum concrete or something
Samuel Adams,It is pure rock
J Cole Patt,=D
Elijah Parker,Jewish laddie
Degan Nestrichal,this is me after JJ blows up my entire base in minecraft and is hellbent on destroying me
Degan Nestrichal,as i sit here and ponder on whether or not i have been a good ally to JJ on the GAY minecraft server
Degan Nestrichal,also fk i have a project due at 4pm and i havent slept y do i keep doing this
Austin Medina,Austin be like: oh fuck bro i have an oil change due at noon
J Cole Patt,"I would like to propose a peace treaty and Alliance.
I have built a courtroom and have gifts and such for everyone. we will settle hostilities."
Samuel Adams,Da moon
Samuel Adams,We will destroy da moon in our quest for dominance
Elijah Parker,Nah sam we need to create a self sufficient community on da moon and blow up Venus.
Elijah Parker,You silly goose.
Elijah Parker,Bobby Shmurda got released from prison like 2 days ago.
Elijah Parker,To pull back like. Shit that happened in middle school.
Samuel Adams,When you get your restraining order in the mail
Elijah Parker,That's an old pic holy fuck.
Elijah Parker,"February 23rd, 2017"
Samuel Adams,2017 was yesterday let's be real
Elijah Parker,With how long 2020 was it was a fuckin decade and a half and you know it.
Austin Medina,Lol all my superiors are having a meeting so im just supposed to manage the garage with me and this one lady
Austin Medina,That guitar tone is so rich man
Elijah Parker,"Lmao imagine referring to them as your superiors and not just ""the assholes who pay me"""
Austin Medina,"They dont pay me, the owner does"
Austin Medina,Theyre my superiors
Elijah Parker,Exactly.
Austin Medina,They are a bunch of dumb assholes tho
Samuel Adams,The breakdown riff about a minute in is pure headbanger material
Samuel Adams,We gotta make a song out of this
Elijah Parker,But nah don't say superiors austino.
Elijah Parker,Say the snakes.
Elijah Parker,Or back stabbers bro.
Elijah Parker,Or. Even Supervisors.
Austin Medina,Theyre not even snakes lmao they just suck at their respective jobs particularly the service director
Austin Medina,Theres no gameplan at all on a day to day basis
Elijah Parker,Calling them your superiors makes you sound like someone who just lets people walk over them though laddie.
Austin Medina,I dont take no shit but they are my superiors in the truest sense because their job rank and responsibilities are higher than mine
Elijah Parker,Nah laddie it's not the definition so much as the principle.
Elijah Parker,Imagine if Kamila Harris started calling herself an inferior to Joe Biden.
Samuel Adams,In a legitimate sense she is
Samuel Adams,Kamala can't use the nukes unless Joe is incapacitated
Elijah Parker,Yes but again.
Elijah Parker,It's not the definition so much as the way it sounds.
Samuel Adams,"There's gonna be power dynamics no matter where you go, no matter what kind of society you live in, that's just how people operate most efficiently"
Samuel Adams,Every team has a leader so to speak
Elijah Parker,Like I would never fuckin call myself an inferior to someone.
Elijah Parker,Yeah true.
Elijah Parker,But that's not like. They're superior to me.
Elijah Parker,They just got that role.
Samuel Adams,"I suppose so, but by merit of having that role they have the ability to make choices and influence people in a way someone else can't"
Elijah Parker,I won't call myself the inferior to anyone because I'm my own person that could even be better at the job than they are.
Elijah Parker,That's true I suppose. Agree to disagree then. Personally it's just the sound of the words inferior and superior and how those are usually used in sentences.
Austin Medina,I hate this fucking job lmfao
J Cole Patt,"im suprised to hear that, but otherwise sad to hear that"
Austin Medina,Gamestop is back on the rise
Austin Medina,That shit was stupid how was i alone supposed to handle anyone that couldve come through the door
Austin Medina,I shouldve just shut the doors down and turned off the lights
Samuel Adams,So nice to be a college student where I can recreate the guitar tone from Them Bones in the relative comfort of my dorm room!
Austin Medina,So sunday or saturday to chill??
J Cole Patt,i wpuldmt mind
Austin Medina,Just waiting on sam because he has his sisters bday

Samuel Adams,Sunday would work my boys
Samuel Adams,Since my sister's birthday is saturday
Austin Medina,Okay cool
Degan Nestrichal,oh so we are not invited to her birthday party? thats fked
Austin Medina,I got an oil leak on my Honda that I'm going to fix on Saturday
Degan Nestrichal,austin we should show up hammered to sams sisters birthday party
Samuel Adams,There's no birthday party kek we're probably just going to a restaurant or something
Degan Nestrichal,ah so shes gotten to that age now
Austin Medina,Let's just go to whatever restaurant Sam's family goes to and will get absolutely smashed
Degan Nestrichal,ill be camping outside austin ill let u know where they go

J Cole Patt,Id like to keep a positive image in his parents head
J Cole Patt,Just so theyd let sam have more leeway
Austin Medina,Meh sam can just sneak from milwaukee anyway
Austin Medina,Although it would be nice to raid his basement
J Cole Patt,Just the basement?
J Cole Patt,The whole house niqqa lets go
Samuel Adams,There ain't much else to do in my house tbh
Austin Medina,His basement is cool as fuck j
Samuel Adams,All the fun stuff is in the basement kek
Austin Medina,We can jam properly there
Austin Medina,Sams basement is the most based in the groupchat
Samuel Adams,J's grandpa's being an honorable mention
Samuel Adams,But alas we cannot jam there for many eons I feel
Degan Nestrichal,sam is the only one with a basement so he kinda win automatically
Samuel Adams,In some ways not having a basement is better than having to really fix up a horrible one
Samuel Adams,"It took a lot of time, effort, and money to get my basement to where it is now lmao"
Samuel Adams,"It was worth it tho, definitely boosted the fuckin property value on the house"
Austin Medina,And we never get to use it :[
Samuel Adams,You're tellin me bruv
Samuel Adams,"But like I said things are looking up because if my dad's case goes well and it looks it is, my mom won't be so anal about having people come over and seeing how terrible the house is! Oh no!"
Samuel Adams,Cuz we'll have money to fix up some shit
Samuel Adams,Covid is another thing but it didn't seem to matter in June when Austin came over lol
Austin Medina,Lol does ur mom think im gonna come in and be like :// uhhh why is the sink draining properly and the floor is slightly dusty
Samuel Adams,Alright boys I'm goin out to dinner I'll be back later
Austin Medina,Did i come over in june tf

Degan Nestrichal,omg austin is gonna roast sams family on the spot
Samuel Adams,We jammed ain't so pretty and heartbreaker
Austin Medina,Oh ye right roight bru
Austin Medina,I saw my first lamborghini today
Austin Medina,Lol
Samuel Adams,"Hey bro, nice cock! Where'd you get it?"
Elijah Parker,Thanks bro! It's been with me all my life!
Elijah Parker,It's like a family heirloom bro!
J Cole Patt,Imagine that
J Cole Patt,You pass ur dick onto ur son and stuff
J Cole Patt,"""this cock has pleased many women son, including your mother, and mow Im giving it to you."""
Elijah Parker,"I mean not your dick. But you technically do ""inherent"" it to some degree."
Samuel Adams,"This cock belonged to my 17th great grandfather, the Earl of Cornwall. It is said he possessed the girthiest hog in all the British Empire, and I'm sure it would warm his heart to know that you now possess it."
Elijah Parker,It's all fossilized and shit.
Elijah Parker,Looks like a fuckin drinking horn the Vikings used to drink out of.
Austin Medina,"Its weird to think my family was once over in europe mainly, i even found out the mexican side had ancestors that came to mexico from spain centuries ago"
Elijah Parker,I don't know too much about my family before the Great depression.
Samuel Adams,"Chronologically speaking, white people in America is a relatively new thing lmao"
Austin Medina,Yeah in the grand scheme of things
Austin Medina,"If the shit i found is actually correct, portions of my family have been in the us since before its inception"
Austin Medina,Others more recently came from mexico and germany
Elijah Parker,I know that my great grandfather came over around 1930 from Ireland. I also know that his last name was O'herlihy. I don't know a ton of details about it but I know that.
Elijah Parker,My grandma told me a little about him and then a lot more about my family onwards.
Austin Medina,"Thats really cool bruh, i have irish ancestors too i didnt reliaze how many irish folks i was related to"
J Cole Patt,Join the IRA
J Cole Patt,I wouldnt be too opposed to fighting the british.
Austin Medina,"Lol idk, theyre just my ancestors i dont think any of them would care about the ongoings of current europe"
Austin Medina,They were americans
Samuel Adams,I used to have a well-developed ancestry thing going somewhere but I don't know where it is now
Elijah Parker,Hi

Austin Medina,@Samuel Adams
Samuel Adams,I enjoy this very much
Samuel Adams,I was soloing over this snippet and it sounds pretty cash
Austin Medina,i gotta work on that shit a bit more
Austin Medina,but basically it is dmaj7 to gmin with some embellishments in between and then towards the end i went gmin > b5 > c#5
Austin Medina,i would say yeah either gmin pentatonic or just make up some riffs around that chord progression
Austin Medina,sounds pretty good
Austin Medina,now we have it on file we can write some stuff with it next time we jam
Samuel Adams,Did you ever tune your guitar back up to standard
Austin Medina,yeah kek
Austin Medina,like right when i got back from mke i think
Austin Medina,"ive been playing quite a bit, mainly been practicing that bach partita in dminor"
Austin Medina,that shit is fucking insane bro it takes a lot of focus to play at the correct tempo
Austin Medina,i got a little bit of it memorized but theres some parts that involve a lot of string skipping and sweeping motions
Austin Medina,"but not sweep picking, the notes are all individually plucked"
Samuel Adams,I am going to school in the Arctic Circle
Elijah Parker,Soon I will be as well
Samuel Adams,It is broad daylight at midnight
Elijah Parker,Damn bro your whole ass town is in hell rn nigga

Degan Nestrichal,alcohol makes u more intelligent
Degan Nestrichal,thats how i fixed my website while drunk then also proceeded to mess it up by accidently entering 1 character where i shouldnt have
Austin Medina,This is objectively true any data presented to try to convince me otherwise will be disregarded as jewish propaganda
Degan Nestrichal,"if u guys want to im down, i gotta get some social interaction bro or else ill end up in existentialist dread like sam! no one deserves to think like sam austin!"

Samuel Adams,So even if this shit is happening next year we can get crunk

Degan Nestrichal,ye dats the best choice but idk it seemed like u rly wanted one rn
Elijah Parker,I did bro but idk man It makes more sense.
Elijah Parker,It's alive still because it's just had its skin ripped off. There's no damage to the internal organs that's visible. He probably got away from a predator.
Elijah Parker,Pretty shit one too if all they do is rip some skin off and don't go for the neck or the heart.
J Cole Patt,combine
Austin Medina,So sam whats the apartment look like??

Austin Medina,gotta get a better job lined up but if i can get a dealership job making like 15 an hour sure
Austin Medina,theyre paying my buddy tom 14 an hour doing oil changes at a ford dealership down the road from my job and im thinking i can expect around that if i get the same position
Degan Nestrichal,thats a nice gig
Degan Nestrichal,yeah i just dont wanna pressure u into moving if its too risky but ye i gotta get this situation sorted out sooner than later
Degan Nestrichal,madison would be sick tho if its post-covid
Degan Nestrichal,theres a lot to do
Austin Medina,I wouldnt count on post covid too much of a wildcard but it would be fun to move anyway
Austin Medina,I would prolly just sell my civic or jeep but probably the civic because snow
Degan Nestrichal,they are planning on in person next semester so it will prob at least be more lively
Austin Medina,"That sounds sick lmao, maybe i could do trade school in that area too just start a new"
Degan Nestrichal,yeah for sure theres a lot of technical/trade schools in the area
Austin Medina,"If i can get good at installing tires and shit i can make decent money, some lube/tire techs can make up to 18 an hour"
Austin Medina,Eventually i wanna be a manager or something maybe a service advisor
Degan Nestrichal,or @JJ Joseph
Austin Medina,"So its kinda a means to end, learn about cars and then transfer into selling people work"
Austin Medina,When exactly would you look to move out there bro

Degan Nestrichal,just jack off with it for a few hrs it will fix it
Degan Nestrichal,austin how long u think its gonna take for u to save up for a house and mortgage tho
Austin Medina,Idk idrc either i just dont like the idea of renting
J Cole Patt,Renting can also be good as well if you have a good landlord.
J Cole Patt,cuz they take care of the house.
Austin Medina,Im not renting lmao
Degan Nestrichal,but ur renting rn sheep!
Degan Nestrichal,idk obv no one likes renting but the barrier to entry in the housing market is high so its easier to rent in the meantime
Austin Medina,Imma just save up a decent lump sum try to put a good amount down and the use the rest as cushion to pay off the first year or so
J Cole Patt,wait for housing market to crash lol
J Cole Patt,The hospital now has my grandparents information and will be scheduling a appoint for the vaccine in the next few weeks.
Austin Medina,Good for them
J Cole Patt,Meaning we can chill in the awesome basement when they get vaccinated.
Samuel Adams,Fuck yeah
J Cole Patt,That will be the most epic of times
J Cole Patt,Learning some johney cash songsd
Samuel Adams,This picture was taken 4 years ago today
Samuel Adams,Fuck we are getting further from HS than the time we spent in it lmao

J Cole Patt,super seniors always look so depressed
J Cole Patt,"""fuck im still here...."""
Austin Medina,Yeah im not a bitch tho so i went hard and got my shit done
Austin Medina,ð¹
Samuel Adams,So were you still technically in hs in September 2019 then?
Austin Medina,Yeah
Austin Medina,But i had like 3 credits to do so i just knocked it out in a month and went on working with ben
J Cole Patt,My goal is to play kickstart my heart
J Cole Patt,eventually
J Cole Patt,and learn the current songs im trying to play
Samuel Adams,Kickstart my heart isn't too difficult
Samuel Adams,It's got some pull offs and quick riffs if you want to play the real version though
J Cole Patt,its def not difficcult but its afst
J Cole Patt,i gotta get quicker with fingering
J Cole Patt,plus develop my fingies more so i can play for longer times
Samuel Adams,"Learning a few Johnny cash songs would be cool too, even if I don't know them I can't pick them up pretty quickly"
J Cole Patt,lmao im actually already on that
Samuel Adams,I can rather lmao
Samuel Adams,Texting in between classes is tuff
Austin Medina,"Im so hyped for summer, i took my civic for a whip around the block and even just this 40 degree weather feels fantastix"
Austin Medina,Me in 20 years
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna live here! I have bought these islands for personal use!
J Cole Patt,?
Elijah Parker,I'd love to own a small little island in the pacific
Elijah Parker,I could make a whole new society bro.
Elijah Parker,A culture of pothead ukulele players.
Samuel Adams,Hawaiians
Elijah Parker,I love the Hawaiians bro
Elijah Parker,I really hope once I'm done with underwater welding I can find a job in it over in Hawaii.
Austin Medina,Just move down south and get a farm to take care of
Elijah Parker,Nah bro.
Samuel Adams,"My parents lived in Hawaii for a while since they were in the navy, it's nice but you eventually miss the seasons"
Elijah Parker,"There's just something about Hawaii. The flora and fauna, the culture, people, weather and all the cool activities that are available like diving in reefs or spelunking."
Samuel Adams,Yeah but I can imagine it becoming a sort of purgatory after a while
Samuel Adams,80 and sunny day after day
Elijah Parker,Oh yeah that's possible. But if that's the case all I've gotta do is move.
Elijah Parker,I'd like to live in Seattle sometime as well.
Samuel Adams,We'll make a pilgrimmage out to Seattle to see the heartland of grunge
Elijah Parker,And lots of rain
Samuel Adams,"We can chill in Discovery Park, where Hunger Strike was formed"
Samuel Adams,Filmed rather
Elijah Parker,I bet they've got really fresh tropical fish at the fish markets in Seattle.
Austin Medina,Seattle seems like a bit of a shithole to me
Elijah Parker,Hol up.
Elijah Parker,I just thought of something.
Austin Medina,Thats probably just because i dont like heroin addicts and homeless niggas
Elijah Parker,If I live in Hawaii you niggas can come visit and it'll be a lot cheaper.
Austin Medina,ð³
Samuel Adams,Heroin addicts are to aspire to
Elijah Parker,Heroin addicts and homeless niggas is legit just kenosha.
Elijah Parker,Only they prefer crack over here.
Samuel Adams,I was gonna say it can't be much worse than here lmao
Samuel Adams,Nah there's a bad opioid epidemic in this region
Austin Medina,"But now if you ever go on Zillow and look at what you can get for $150,000 on South vs here you'd realize why I want to move there"
Elijah Parker,Washington in general is pretty heavy with druggies.
Elijah Parker,Which sucks because aside from Hawaii and Alaska it's got one of the best natural looks to it.
Samuel Adams,Notice how all of the depressing music is made by people who grew up in shitholes with gloomy climates lmao
Elijah Parker,Bro I should make sad nigga music.
Samuel Adams,"Guns N Roses and Motley Crue were in sunny southern california and their music is all about the glory of sex, drugs, and rock n roll"
Samuel Adams,GNR less so than Motley Crue but you get the point
Elijah Parker,Scarlxrd is british and instead of being depressed he got angry.
Elijah Parker,King Krule has some depressing fuckin songs and he's also british.
Elijah Parker,Fuck I can kinda see what you mean now.
Samuel Adams,I personally write some sad fuckin songs and I grew up in a shithole with an ambiguous climate
Elijah Parker,In fact like. 70 percent of King Krule's discography is sad or has a sad vibe to it.
Elijah Parker,It's hotter than hell in the summer sometimes.
Samuel Adams,Kenosha is my muse for the end of the world
Elijah Parker,110 with no wind.
Samuel Adams,"All roads lead to here, and you don't want to get to the end of that road"
Elijah Parker,Nah bro I've gotta take the road out I'll see y'all niggas on the flippedy flip
Samuel Adams,"I always feel a glum atmosphere whenever I roll back into town, maybe because it also feels like a limbo state itself"
Elijah Parker,I agree bro. Like when London and I went up to Milwaukee when we got back I all of a sudden was bummed as fuck.
Samuel Adams,Think about how fucked it is that the most Kenosha has changed is when it was being destroyed
Elijah Parker,Had to cuddle her for like 20 minutes to feel better bro.
Elijah Parker,And then I had to play my ukulele as well to distract myself on top of it. This whole town has like a fuckin sad nigga spell on it.
J Cole Patt,Kenosha always gives me a bad vibe. shit is quite fucked.
J Cole Patt,especially when you hear about pedo stories and such.
Elijah Parker,Not even just that bro. It's fucking filthy and full of crack heads or people just completely down on their luck.
Elijah Parker,Nobody actually LIKES kenosha that's ever actually seen kenosha.
Samuel Adams,"Nobody's moving downtown to open new stores, build new communities, etc it's all happening towards the outskirts lmao"
Samuel Adams,Kenosha is somehow getting bigger but the town itself isn't seeing the benefit of any of that
Elijah Parker,Yeah true. White Caps be seeing hella growth tho ð
Samuel Adams,It's pretty much you're either comfortably rich or dirt poor here
Elijah Parker,Yeah that's accurate.
Samuel Adams,All of the neighborhoods are slowly devolving into what the worst part of town used to look like
Samuel Adams,"We gotta get out of here boys, there are greener pastures somewhere"
Elijah Parker,Also true. I hope my grandparents end up getting outta here once I head off to job Corps.
J Cole Patt,only thing keno b good for is cheap rent.
J Cole Patt,"which my dad scraped by enough to actually live in a nice neighborhood, but its still a fairly small apartment."
Elijah Parker,In keno?
J Cole Patt,"yeah, its on the edge of town though."
Elijah Parker,Wood Creek apartments?
Elijah Parker,Or is it like. Out there out there?
J Cole Patt,probably
Elijah Parker,Is it like right across the street from a piggy wiggly?
J Cole Patt,orchard court apartmnets
J Cole Patt,its a studio
Elijah Parker,Oh yeah no those are the new new ones.
Samuel Adams,Those are out by the country club
Elijah Parker,yeah that's out there out there.
Samuel Adams,"My point exactly that Kenosha is almost like a failed city, your suburban area shouldn't be better off than your urban area lmao"
Elijah Parker,But yeah no I kinda picked up on just how broke kenosha is when London and I got in an argument about what counts as designer clothes.
Elijah Parker,I count things like Nike and Adidas as designer while she considers specifically things like Gucci as designer.
Samuel Adams,I think that's a gender difference too tbf
Elijah Parker,Basically if it's got a recognizable brand and it's good quality I count it as designer.
Samuel Adams,Most lads don't really give a shit about real high end clothing lmao
Elijah Parker,I don't really care about the name on my clothes.
Elijah Parker,I'll go for generic shit just because it's cheaper lmao.
Elijah Parker,"I mean even some shit like fuckin Champion to me is designer. I recognize the brand. It's high quality, warm and feels nice to wear."
Austin Medina,Im either going down south or to the desert areas
Samuel Adams,I don't know where I'll end up
Elijah Parker,If you're going deserts avoid Nevada.
Samuel Adams,Wherever the wind takes me I guess
Elijah Parker,Nevada is more expensive through the whole state because of vegas I believe.
Elijah Parker,Could be wrong tho.
Elijah Parker,London whenever I gently touch her face when she's asleep.
Elijah Parker,She literally twitched so bad when I did it last night she headbutted the fuck out of my nose. It started bleeding for a little bit.
Elijah Parker,ð
Samuel Adams,Chicago folks are prepared to fight off home invaders even in their sleep
Austin Medina,Lol
Elijah Parker,She really was bro.
Elijah Parker,"She woke up because I started sneezing and she's like ""hey there's blood running down your face what happened"""
Austin Medina,Kek
Austin Medina,Eddie where you gonna move?
Samuel Adams,And actually Eli I think it's harder to buy property in Nevada because it's quite a barren desert and there's a section of it in the northeast where there's absolutely no one lives
Elijah Parker,Isn't it also more expensive though because of Vegas? Like they charge more for shit. Like how gas or food or whatever is more expensive in Chicago than here according to London.
Austin Medina,This would probably be like 400k in il
Samuel Adams,1036 a month are you shittin me lmao
Samuel Adams,Boys let's just pool our funds together
Elijah Parker,I got like.
Elijah Parker,20 chili beans
J Cole Patt,If they can take cash and not say anything abt said cash. i can give like 10
Austin Medina,That's a ballpark estimate im pretty sure
J Cole Patt,"or, er 2K i mean."
J Cole Patt,Although that shit lookes neato
Austin Medina,I just want a decent house i care more about having some land to work with and enjoy
Austin Medina,Thats also 2 acres
J Cole Patt,Gonna make a paintball arena lol
Elijah Parker,I hate big houses.
Elijah Parker,I'd love like. A small bungalow.
Elijah Parker,Especially with only one story. I don't usually like 2 stories
Austin Medina,"I fuckin love big houses, just more room for potential"
Elijah Parker,Well.
Elijah Parker,With me not wanting to have kids I don't need it yk?
Austin Medina,Ive been in a few places that just blew my mind but the most impressive was this french inspired construction in lake forest that had a hot tub and in ground pool in the basement
Degan Nestrichal,austin thats a dumb idea we could instead get a quarter of a studio apartment in LA in the gangbanger area we could become millionaires out of that
Elijah Parker,At max I'm going to have a family of 2 people (including me) and some cats that live in my household.
Austin Medina,I knew this girl who has family that owns apartments in la theyre fuckin rich as hell
Elijah Parker,So therefore I don't need much space. I like smaller spaces anyway.
Austin Medina,She moved out there to work for them
Austin Medina,Idrc how much family i have i just like extravagant shit
Degan Nestrichal,austin lets just get an RV and travel
Elijah Parker,Probably at least a multi thousandaire by now
Austin Medina,Thatd actually be dank ngl lmao
Degan Nestrichal,bruh we just both get remote jobs
Degan Nestrichal,live in an RV
Elijah Parker,Eddie you're working on programming bro.
Elijah Parker,You could live mobile ez
Austin Medina,Ill sell drugs! That can be mobile
Degan Nestrichal,that is indeed what im saying
Elijah Parker,Weed mobile
Austin Medina,Lol northern il has zero of what i want smh im out
Elijah Parker,What do you want
Degan Nestrichal,gay midget prostitutes
Austin Medina,"Under 250k, 3 beds 2 bath and 2 acres"
Elijah Parker,Try Minnesota.
Elijah Parker,Or Michigan.
Degan Nestrichal,eli knows where to find the gay midget prostitutes
Austin Medina,Liberals
Elijah Parker,Illinois is expensive laddy that's the issue.
Austin Medina,I go to alabama theres inbreds but no liberals
Elijah Parker,What's better tho
Austin Medina,Inbreds
Austin Medina,Ezily
Elijah Parker,I'd much rather have liberals lad
Elijah Parker,But to each their own.
Elijah Parker,Try Texas then.
Elijah Parker,Or Tennessee.
Elijah Parker,Tennessee is super fuckin cheap.
Degan Nestrichal,theres only 1 thing worse than being a liberal eli and that is being a goddam mexican living in america
Austin Medina,Alabama is cheaper
Austin Medina,Yes i hate mexicans
Elijah Parker,I
Elijah Parker,alright
Degan Nestrichal,lol this libtard is stumbling on his words! pathetic!
Elijah Parker,Lmao
Elijah Parker,But yeah no you're not gonna find that in Illinois laddie
Austin Medina,Illinois is so fucked anyway its so corrupt and shitty
Austin Medina,I just wanna be left alone and not deal with bs like big taxes and dumbass neighbors
Austin Medina,If i had enough i would go for something with even more land but at some point it becomes too much and its impossible to take care of all the land
Elijah Parker,If I had enough I'd just by a small island in the Pacific for like a milli and have you live there.
Elijah Parker,Only solar power tho
Austin Medina,Fug yeah im down
Degan Nestrichal,*jj's mental cock starts throbbing*
Elijah Parker,Solar and wind actually.
Elijah Parker,If it's an island wind would be a good idea too.
Degan Nestrichal,no internet bro bad idea
Austin Medina,Oooooo honda seevic
Elijah Parker,So? Bro you live on an island lmao
Elijah Parker,If you want internet you're a madman.
Degan Nestrichal,suzuki forenza beats the honda civic in the swag department imo
Degan Nestrichal,if u want an island ur a madman
Degan Nestrichal,that sounds awful
Elijah Parker,Go fishing or diving or exploring or something bro fuck get off ur phone lmao

Samuel Adams,What ever happened to those gals have you ever interacted with them beyond that night
Elijah Parker,Somewhat but just when london has called them or something lmao
Elijah Parker,Apparently they want me to hang out but I hate college campuses bro
Degan Nestrichal,all they know is use cell phone and use apple products! fucking disgusting normies
Elijah Parker,"Especially Carthage. There's a ton of those ""daddy's money"" type kids."
Degan Nestrichal,it sickens me deeply
Elijah Parker,"Eddie be like ""fuckin zoomers"""
Samuel Adams,Some day we will meet them again
Samuel Adams,And god damnit we will drink even more
Elijah Parker,nO
Elijah Parker,BAD IDEA
Degan Nestrichal,u drink anymore than that night and u become drunk eli
Elijah Parker,Full on gorilla bro
Elijah Parker,Angry and stupid
Samuel Adams,Even when I'm not all there I am not a hostile person lmao
Samuel Adams,I'm proud of that I can hold my liquor even when I'm incapable of holding it ð¥µ
Elijah Parker,Bro you don't understand laddie
Elijah Parker,Once I'm gone I'm GONE bro
Elijah Parker,Like when I'm sober or stoned or even just somewhat drunk I don't want to fight at all.
Degan Nestrichal,im remembering that game of valorant i played drunk and high and couldnt even aim at anything
Elijah Parker,But like idk. I get angry as fuck when I'm gone. Probably because I bottle shit up too much and don't let anger out in a healthy way bro!
Degan Nestrichal,gross looking car
Austin Medina,Nah bruh honda seevic
Austin Medina,I wanna remove the chrome trim on the hood i might just
Samuel Adams,EM2 Civic

Degan Nestrichal,srsly stop being nerds
Samuel Adams,It's good to have passions
Elijah Parker,what the FUCK is an si? besides yes in Spanish
Degan Nestrichal,yes is hola in spanish
Elijah Parker,That's hello fuck you
Samuel Adams,It's just a different kind of Civic
Degan Nestrichal,no ur thinking of a different dialect..
Elijah Parker,what's the difference though
Degan Nestrichal,mexican spanish
Degan Nestrichal,hola = yes
Elijah Parker,Eddie
Elijah Parker,ð
Elijah Parker,okay
Samuel Adams,"Y'all are both wrong because si without an accented i is just ""if"" you fucking idiots!"
Degan Nestrichal,its a weird difference but its true
Degan Nestrichal,like Hola papa
Degan Nestrichal,means yes dad
Degan Nestrichal,different dialects of spanish
Elijah Parker,SÃ­ papi
Degan Nestrichal,no dat means fuck me daddy in mexican spanish
Samuel Adams,But the Si is a hatchback no
Austin Medina,"An si is just a sportier civic, it has a better motor"
Austin Medina,Some are some arent
Austin Medina,Like theres a 99 civic si sedan
Elijah Parker,can't you just replace the motor nigga
Austin Medina,And then later years its a hatch and then it goes back to a sedan
Degan Nestrichal,shid eli knows more than u austin
Samuel Adams,Easier said than done Eli
Austin Medina,In theory yeah but its a huge job lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,step up ur game
Elijah Parker,bro austin bro
Elijah Parker,You love cars bro
Elijah Parker,You want to be a mechanic
Samuel Adams,An engine replacement would probably cost more than the car itself depending on what engine you're putting into it and how much you paid ofr the car
Elijah Parker,think of it as a project
Elijah Parker,simple as
Elijah Parker,duh just build the whole engine stupid!
Elijah Parker,That's probably like.
Elijah Parker,400 dollars max
Austin Medina,Thatd be pretty difficult lmao
Degan Nestrichal,thatd be 200 dollars max austin
Degan Nestrichal,just do it lazy white latino male smh
Samuel Adams,The same world where an engine can be built for 400 dollars is the same world where you can get a good guitar for 20 bucks
Elijah Parker,Check mate atheists.
Elijah Parker,lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,u can get a good guitar for 20 bucks
Samuel Adams,Aw shid lemme finance this engine replacement job
Degan Nestrichal,ski mask + fake gun < $20

Elijah Parker,bro it's a fuckin limo duh!
Samuel Adams,"Two separate engines, one for each axle"
Samuel Adams,"Yknow I wonder if cars have ever done this, if it'd be more efficient"
Elijah Parker,Only real men will understand sam
Samuel Adams,Almost like how more processors to perform simultaneous tasks are more efficient than having one big processor to switch between multiple tasks quickly
Elijah Parker,The kind that appreciate 4 colors on their extended truck
Samuel Adams,Ultimate AWD; two drivetrains and two engines for two sets of wheels
Samuel Adams,You can always turn one engine off to get FWD or RWD
Samuel Adams,It's genius
Elijah Parker,What the FUCK are you talking about
Samuel Adams,"When a car moves, the engine is generating power through some means which is then distributed to the wheels by a sequence of highly complicated shafts and flywheels"
Elijah Parker,mate
Elijah Parker,forget I asked lmao
Samuel Adams,No you're going to get the full scoop because it pleases me
Samuel Adams,Why don't you want to become knowledgeable in another field you're unfamiliar with Eli
Elijah Parker,No means no ð«
Samuel Adams,It is very cool
Samuel Adams,Just the other day you had no idea how to play a ukelele and now you're getting somewhere with it
Elijah Parker,Idc about cars
Samuel Adams,That's how quickly your interests can change
Elijah Parker,ð
Elijah Parker,But lad
Elijah Parker,I've not cared about cars actively for years.
Samuel Adams,"Anyways the place where the power actually goes is dictated by your drivetrain, which is either front wheel drive where the front wheels propel the car, rear wheel drive, and then you can have a mode where all four wheels are getting power"
Elijah Parker,ð­ð­ð­ð­
Samuel Adams,"If you had two engines, each axle would have its own power supply, which would be a ghetto way of getting 4 wheel drive and if you turned off the front engine, only the rear wheels would be getting power which would be a ghetto way of getting RWD rofl"
Samuel Adams,Austin would have to weigh in on whether or not this is a feasible concept as opposed to just having a transfer case
Samuel Adams,"Another thought occurred to me, if the inefficiency with this idea is that it's simply too heavy, do we have the materials to make lighter engines?"
Elijah Parker,ð
Austin Medina,Shit so this is complex idea but what it boils down to is it kind of cant be done cheaply
Austin Medina,Like that koenigsegg that has electric motors for putting out torque to the wheels at low speed that eventually transfers from being powered by electric motors to an internal combustion engine is the only thing i can think of
Austin Medina,But i guess in theory it would work if its already been done
Austin Medina,"Might not be as practical from a fuel efficiency stand point or weight and stuff, we could probably figure out ways to make lighter engines but typical theyre made of either iron or aluminum because it needs to be able to withstand the heat of combustion"
Degan Nestrichal,G.A.Y. members be like ð¥µ
Austin Medina,I love audis bruv
Degan Nestrichal,J be like ð
J Cole Patt,they dont own legal guns.
J Cole Patt,"Either way, casing them is ez af."
Austin Medina,Gonna go with my homie pepe after work to pick up another civic
Austin Medina,Shits far asf tho lmao
Samuel Adams,How far is far
Austin Medina,Like hour and a half into wisco
J Cole Patt,Fairly far.
Austin Medina,I just hope we dont get robbed
J Cole Patt,You wont get robbed if you are moving.
J Cole Patt,Only if you stop moving.
Austin Medina,Were going to buy a 400 dollar honda civic from a guy with no pfp on facebook
Austin Medina,Theres a chance
Samuel Adams,Are you locked and loaded
Austin Medina,Lol
Austin Medina,No
J Cole Patt,Uh
J Cole Patt,Rip
Austin Medina,I aint worried lol
Samuel Adams,This is the dude Austin is buying a 400 dollar civic off of
Austin Medina,Im not buying shit im driving it back for my friend
Austin Medina,I dont have no need for another civic
Samuel Adams,What are the specs on this mecha suit how is he getting it for 400 lmao
Austin Medina,"01 civic, automatic, 200k miles needs fuel lines due to leaks"
Austin Medina,So gl to me making it home
Samuel Adams,Why does he want this junker lmao
Austin Medina,Hes a mechanic
Austin Medina,Fix it and sell it
Austin Medina,Assuming it runs and drives 400 is actually probably a steal
Austin Medina,If its just fuel lines thats not that bad
Degan Nestrichal,yo @Elijah Parker u should get this computer
Degan Nestrichal,i have now officially spent $1.38 on the minecraft server! fk!
J Cole Patt,Ah fuck
Degan Nestrichal,my free creds are up
J Cole Patt,Lmao 4 gb of ram but 160GB
J Cole Patt,Rip
J Cole Patt,How does that work???
Degan Nestrichal,that is 8gb ram
Degan Nestrichal,160 gb SSD
Degan Nestrichal,4 virtual cores
Degan Nestrichal,dats the minecraft server
Degan Nestrichal,anyways ye i put in $25 to the mc server that should last almost a month im thinking
Degan Nestrichal,or idk
Degan Nestrichal,this picture is gonna be infamous when me and sam commit crimes against humanity!
Samuel Adams,Lmao
Degan Nestrichal,god those college videos are too painful to watch
J Cole Patt,Amazing.
Samuel Adams,My madre wants to get a subaru and then I found this lawsuit online
Samuel Adams,"""Had plaintiffs and other Class Members known of the Sudden Acceleration Defect, they would have paid less for the Class Vehicles or would not have purchased or leased them."""
Samuel Adams,Who the fuck is gonna buy a car that can suddenly and unexpectedly accelerate lmao
Austin Medina,I would
Austin Medina,Sounds fast
Samuel Adams,"Pulling up to my driveway all leisurely, today was ni-oh fuck I just drove through my garage door, oh fuck I just drove through my garage, oh fuck I just ran over an unsuspecting child on the other side of my neighbor's fence"
Austin Medina,Fuck them kids nigga
Austin Medina,Racecar bitch
Samuel Adams,A racecar's only as good as how well you can control it kek
Austin Medina,"Just in case i get killed over 400 bucks, sam you can have my jeep and eddie can have the civic"
Austin Medina,Yeah im just fuckin wit u
Austin Medina,Does it say what model years that applies to
Samuel Adams,Now I wonder if my mom's gonna be like OMG WHY'D YOU TELL ME NOW I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME
Samuel Adams,"2012-2018 foresters, legacys, and outbacks"
Samuel Adams,Pretty sure my mom was looking to get a forester or a legacy and she has a thing about not wanting older model year cars even though this problem is probably caused by the fact that they don't have throttle cables and are totally electronic
Samuel Adams,"Actually it's 12-18 forester, and 15-19 legacy and outback models but still I don't think she wants to get anything older than '17"
Austin Medina,Just tell her to buy a Honda
Austin Medina,And dont get a turbo car
Austin Medina,It's just another thing that can break
Samuel Adams,She was thinking if she doesn't get a subaru she'd fuck with a volvo too lmao
Elijah Parker,I would get one if the old school out backs. The ones that look a lot like a station wagon.
Elijah Parker,Not that no
Austin Medina,Tell her to buy a GMC
Elijah Parker,Hell yeah whip that shit nigga
Samuel Adams,"Honda, GMC, which is it gonna be"
Samuel Adams,When I think of inevitable breakdown I think of GMC
Elijah Parker,Toyotas are good cars from what I've heard.
Elijah Parker,"Safe, works well and not super expensive."
Samuel Adams,Toyotas are pretty nice yeah
Austin Medina,Yeah gm is pretty shit
Elijah Parker,They also usually look good so that's a plus as well.
Austin Medina,Their cars are very comfortable tho
Elijah Parker,I think it's FT Cruisers are the Toyota Jeeps essentially.
Austin Medina,Fj cruisers ye
Elijah Parker,Fuck it's FJ.
Austin Medina,Damn g this acadia is stock asf and its still 36k
Elijah Parker,I was thinking PT Cruisers as well lmao
Samuel Adams,"I wonder who looked at the blueprints for a PT Cruiser and said fuck yeah, we want to invest the resources into making thousands of these and selling them"
Elijah Parker,In terms of looks I think they look decent.
Elijah Parker,Reminds me of old school cars.
Elijah Parker,The interiors are pretty nice albeit cramped from what I remember.
Samuel Adams,Austin I'm gonna buy an 03 Tahoe and turn it into a ricer you can't fucking stop me
Elijah Parker,But idk nor do I really care about the mechanics. Are they trash mechanically?
Austin Medina,Idk shit about pt cruisers but im sure theyre just like any other domestic american car
Austin Medina,Dog shit
Samuel Adams,Chryslers as a whole are pretty nasty
Austin Medina,300s are swag at least
Elijah Parker,Okay so you guys know things about cars.
Austin Medina,But yeah idek any other chryslers i would drive
Elijah Parker,What brands should I definitely check out and which ones should I definitely avoid?
Austin Medina,Avoid everything german rn
Austin Medina,Until you have deeper pockets and i mean like full time career
Austin Medina,Cuz they r expensive as fuck to maintain
Elijah Parker,German cars are ones I'm gonna likely avoid all the time.
Samuel Adams,"Most American cars aren't worth buying atm either, maybe Ford but I'm probably biased kek"
Degan Nestrichal,lol learn how to drive first losers!
Elijah Parker,Expensive.
Samuel Adams,You're generally well off getting a japanese car but that doesn't always hold true because I just discovered that recent subarus are subject to suddenly accelerating and killing grandmas at stoplights
Elijah Parker,That's my biggest fear bro.
Samuel Adams,"And if you're willing to get an older model chevy or ford with decent mileage, those are also pretty sick because I think the problem with most modern cars is the electronics haven't quite caught up to the dependability of the mechanical bits they've replaced"
Degan Nestrichal,dude if u drive a car u have a chance of killing a grandma
Degan Nestrichal,u also have a chance of dying
Samuel Adams,My dad is an advocate for dodge but I have never heard anything good about dodges outside of racing lmao
Elijah Parker,Man that really makes me not want to drive eddo
Degan Nestrichal,not to mention u could also kill babies
Degan Nestrichal,and CHILDREN
Samuel Adams,Well you have a random chance of dying at any point from a sudden brain aneurysm Eli
Degan Nestrichal,holy fk driving is so dangerous i just realized this bruv im selling my car and getting a bike
Samuel Adams,Nothing you can do about it kek
Austin Medina,Yeah buy honda toyota nissan subaru lexus acura hyundai or kia
Austin Medina,At first
Austin Medina,Old jeep and yeah as sam said old fords and chevys are good too
Austin Medina,But yeah modern american cars are an electrical nightmare because every feature at the higher trim levels is controlled by computers and motors instead of being mechanical
Samuel Adams,Parts aren't quite as interchangeable either
Samuel Adams,Either this is the future or 2010-2020 cars are going to be swiftly forgotten in a few decades because we lost our head in electronics kek
Degan Nestrichal,OMG bikes arent safe either
Degan Nestrichal,fk im staying home
Samuel Adams,Eddie stays home and is swiftly killed by a burglar who wants his computer!
Samuel Adams,"Fuck you're not even safe at home, what can you do?"
Samuel Adams,Just gotta live life babes
Elijah Parker,It's not dying that I'm worried about.
Elijah Parker,It's killing someone and then living through it.
Degan Nestrichal,gonna live in a reclusive area and mail bombs to airlines and universities
Samuel Adams,"But if you approach driving with that mentality, you'll actually be a worse driver than if you just followed the rules of the road and paid attention"
Samuel Adams,It'll be a self-fulfilling prophecy at that point
Degan Nestrichal,im gonna be referred to as the university n airline bomber
Samuel Adams,university n airline...una...bomber... Hey wait where have I fucking heard this before?!
Degan Nestrichal,actually driving is much less scary than thinking about it nerds!
Elijah Parker,I mean you could say the same for skydiving tho.
Elijah Parker,But you said you don't want to go skydiving
Degan Nestrichal,comparing driving to skydiving in terms of intensity..
Degan Nestrichal,ok
Elijah Parker,That's the thing you don't understand laddie
Elijah Parker,With how anxious I am about driving it is comparable
Samuel Adams,I mean you can get pretty damn close in a car but if you're going that fast you probably don't care what happens anyway
Degan Nestrichal,driving u push on a pedal for 10-20 mins to get to ur destination
Elijah Parker,I'd rather skydive than drive even
Samuel Adams,Eli most driving is done at sub-50 mph speeds and at those speeds any crash is not likely to kill someone unless their car's safety features fail them
Samuel Adams,Only time I've gotten nervous in a car in the past few months is when Austin near got sideways on the fuckin highway in his jeep lmao
Elijah Parker,Sam.
Elijah Parker,I don't want to explain this over and over.
Elijah Parker,But I can't explain why it's so scary to me.
Degan Nestrichal,lol its only scary until u actually know how to drive and do it
Samuel Adams,Have you ever fired a gun Eli?
Elijah Parker,Yes
Samuel Adams,"Before you ever fired a gun, were you scared of the possibility that you might kill someone with it because you didn't know what to do with it?"
Elijah Parker,I've got a video of me shooting a revolver and a few pics of me with a rifle I believe.
Elijah Parker,Yes
Samuel Adams,"But you fired the gun, no one was killed, and you actually gained great experience from it"
Elijah Parker,But the thing is I had my grandma and grandpa there to guide me.
Samuel Adams,Who would give you enough comfort to drive safely then?
Elijah Parker,All I've had when I've driven was a toddler screaming in the back seat and completely distracting me and my mom scream back at the screaming toddler that's distracting me and making me even more distracted.
Elijah Parker,I almost ran over a cat.
Degan Nestrichal,fear of driving is just inexperience with driving
Degan Nestrichal,its natural
Samuel Adams,And you had a bad experience with driving because I'm assuming it wasn't meant to be a learning experience
Elijah Parker,"It was really scary. I felt absolutely horrible, had an anxiety attack and kinda decided I couldn't do it."
Samuel Adams,Otherwise why would you be bringing a toddler along
Elijah Parker,That when combined with the fact I got it a few crashes when I was younger.
Samuel Adams,"That'd be like, in this analogy, someone having to use a gun for the first time to defend their home"
Degan Nestrichal,lmao everyone has awful experiences first couple of times driving because the person teaching u is scared and is usually trusting u with their vehicle
Samuel Adams,"Case in point, Eddie gave me a great pointer about how people new to driving tend to drive too far over because they're used to the perspective of the passenger seat"
Samuel Adams,Now I know that and it's not a mistake I'll make again
Elijah Parker,Idk man. I've gotta find someone to teach me anyway.
Samuel Adams,"I'm sort of in the same boat, I don't wanna say I could do a dry run of a driving test and ace it because that would just be arrogance on my part"
Samuel Adams,But the most important part is that panicking about it will actually make you react in a worse way than if you were level-headed and assessed the situation
Samuel Adams,"Fight or flight works if you're on foot, not so much if you're in a 2000 pound mechasuit that can do 110 mph"
Degan Nestrichal,driving like programming like playing music like ripping fat stinky pussy OG bongs is something you can only learn by doing it
Elijah Parker,Thanks guys
Elijah Parker,Maybe I'll see if London wouldn't mind teaching me the basics. I can also get free driving school at job Corps.
Samuel Adams,Now that the weather's getting nicer that's probably a safe bet
Samuel Adams,When do you leave for job corps anyway?
Elijah Parker,Still not sure laddie.
Elijah Parker,Covid is making shit so slow it's like it's covered in molasses.
Samuel Adams,Lmao Eddie remember when I drove Austin's jeep through that suburban area and killed all of those fucking rich white people it was hilarious xD
Degan Nestrichal,"lol i remember when that one karen started saying ""hey, wait! I got a new complaint!"" and you ran her over out of pure rage, thinking Heart-Shaped Box was the only nirvana song she knew!"
Samuel Adams,"Haha! That was fucking funny! Then as I drove away, I heard a man in a suit with several tattoos say ""Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old"" and I was reassured to know that people actually listen to the other songs on In Utero!"
Austin Medina,"Eli bro dont even worry about driving, its like any other skill. Eventually itll become second nature and youll be commuting no problem"
Degan Nestrichal,"lol then i remember we passed by a perfume shop and some teenager employee walked outside, threw his hat on the floor, and said to his boss ""You can't fire me because I quit!"""
Degan Nestrichal,"right outside the perfume shop we also saw a crackhead say to another crackhead ""I'm lucky to have met you"". God its so reassuring to know that kurts work is still known today"
Samuel Adams,"We nearly walked into that perfume shop, but the owner was irate! All I could make out from his rage was ""GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"""
Degan Nestrichal,"yeah that was weird. What was even weirder was when he stopped at that McDonalds and some dude from out of town kept telling us ""gotta find a way, find a way, when im there"", each time increasing in volume."
Samuel Adams,"LOL and then they kicked him out and said the person next in line could get his food for free because of the ruckus he caused. Only problem with that was we were already getting two separate orders, but Austin wisely said ""I don't even care, we could have all three"""
Degan Nestrichal,"lol and then when it was our time to order austin walked up to the cashier and just said ""Big cheese, make me!"""
Degan Nestrichal,mf talking like yoda xD
Samuel Adams,"Remember when we watched that one to catch a predator video clip? That dude was so fuckin creepy talking to the decoy on the phone sayin ""Goodbye my little darling, I'll see you soon"" XD"
Degan Nestrichal,"lol then chris hansen said to the predator ""Everybody sees u, wouldnt wanna be u"""
Degan Nestrichal,i watched this episode of TCAP where the dude got married 3 weeks before
Austin Medina,We in the middle of nowhere
Degan Nestrichal,dude eli u need to get a computer so u can stripmine this fast with an insanium pickaxe
Austin Medina,So this trip turned out to be completely worth it the car that he got for four hundred bucks runs and drives and has a lot of new parts on it it's pretty sick it's a Honda Accord
Degan Nestrichal,glad u didnt get mugged and killed austin that woulda ruined my hour
Austin Medina,No Stranger To Sorrow joined the call.
Elijah Parker,Love's A Fashion We Can't Wear joined the call.
Austin Medina,The call ended.
Samuel Adams,So I just learned because of my dad's VA disability rating that I might be eligible for chapter 35 benefits
Degan Nestrichal,wut does that entail
Samuel Adams,"As long as I'm in school I think I get 1224 a month, I'm not sure if that counts for only the months I'm actually taking classes or the entire year"
Samuel Adams,"Probably the former because it depends on me being a full-time student, which I have no intention of not being one"
Samuel Adams,"Still, that's pretty big"
Samuel Adams,If I get this and a cushy internship I'll be raking in the fuckin dough
Samuel Adams,"Aside from that though, my dad was saying they might even do backpay from either the start of this semester or the start of my dad's benefits which was circa November 2019, and if that's the case holy fuck I'll be sitting on some cash"
Samuel Adams,"Not getting my hopes up though, just a possibility"
Degan Nestrichal,shit thatd be insane
Austin Medina,Hope u get as much as possible bro
Samuel Adams,"I mean, a lump sum payment of 15k can't be overstated that's probably greater than or equal to all the money I've ever had in my life thus far lmao"
Austin Medina,Made it back safe from the west and imma head home rn
Samuel Adams,If this goes well for me there's a fuckin steak dinner on me boys
Samuel Adams,We celebrate big money moves in the GAY
Elijah Parker,Like buying the island in the Pacific
Samuel Adams,An island in the pacific sounds nice until you realize you have to get over there first
Elijah Parker,Boats
Samuel Adams,And then you have to stock the island with all the things you want and pay for the shipping and the building materials
Elijah Parker,Fuck tru
Elijah Parker,Just move to Hawaii lol
Austin Medina,What is this
Austin Medina,LMAO
Austin Medina,lol eddie you are such a nigger!
Samuel Adams,Preserved for future generations
Elijah Parker,a fossil
Elijah Parker,Bro Forest Whitaker used to be a big mf lmao.
Elijah Parker,Fuckin intimidating.
Degan Nestrichal,jj definitely the one rewatching these 50 times
Degan Nestrichal,"spamming ""show feet"", ""show feet"""
Degan Nestrichal,she has got to be the slowest bed wars player i have seen on the face of the earth
Samuel Adams,Why does she look so spooky in these thumbnails lmao
Degan Nestrichal,just quit austin and make an app after learning coding
Degan Nestrichal,lmao its so easy
Degan Nestrichal,ur playing life on hard mode
Austin Medina,Being a porter is easy it's just annoying
Degan Nestrichal,lmao just get a sex change and be a twitch streamer its easy austin
Degan Nestrichal,sam we gotta hit her with biggirllover92 and caligirlniggerexterminator229
Austin Medina,Bro who is that girl lol
Degan Nestrichal,jj's former love interest
Samuel Adams,She doesn't like basements! Fuck there goes my chances! My only redeeming quality is my semi-pimped out basement!
J Cole Patt,Rip
Austin Medina,Kek
Austin Medina,Is that the one thats weird as fuck
Samuel Adams,Lmao you could say that
Degan Nestrichal,ye JJ only two criteria for women are liberal and dyed hair
Samuel Adams,Oh lord I was skipping around the stream and they're talking about playing a fnaf game
Samuel Adams,"Exhibit 1A, the modern dyed hair liberal woman!"
Degan Nestrichal,her streams were too dry to watch
Samuel Adams,Perpetually stuck in a stage of being 13!
Degan Nestrichal,im not saying i could be more entertaining but fk
Samuel Adams,Our combined charisma could create a successful stream guaranteed
Samuel Adams,We're just better at everything! Inferiors like Soulsticeisabsent need not apply!
Degan Nestrichal,imagine playing minecraft bed wars unironically! fucking unironic childlike normie!
Austin Medina,I used to stream
Austin Medina,I got affiliate
Samuel Adams,Great American Youth's claim to fame will be our famously successful twitch career
Degan Nestrichal,we are too esoteric for streaming
Samuel Adams,We'll just get Eli drunk and put him in front of the camera
Samuel Adams,Easy money
Degan Nestrichal,yo what the fuck is good my boys? sam.. i love you..
Austin Medina,Lol i thought eli sent that
Samuel Adams,Sam.
Samuel Adams,Have I ever told you how much I fuckin love you bro?
Samuel Adams,Like.
Samuel Adams,We go way back homie.
Degan Nestrichal,lmao this is Eli's chatbot
Elijah Parker,Fuck you.
Samuel Adams,<3
Samuel Adams,Oh fuck we gotta change the emoji it's not valentine's day anymore!
Samuel Adams,Two Of A Kind changed the chat theme to Kiwi.
Austin Medina,Whats the next holiday
Austin Medina,Easter no?
Samuel Adams,Two Of A Kind set the emoji to ð®ðª.
Samuel Adams,ð®ðª
Austin Medina,Right
Samuel Adams,"It is famously called ""Ireland Holiday"""
Degan Nestrichal,Sam.
Elijah Parker,Me favorite.
Degan Nestrichal,I found a used guitar for $20 on eBay.
Degan Nestrichal,ð
Degan Nestrichal,Your boy is about to shred.
Austin Medina,Damn nigga chick fil a be smackin we gotta get some next time we chill
Austin Medina,ð®ðª
Samuel Adams,I love Chicken Filet
Degan Nestrichal,"Fug bro just got done reading about how VTEC (Variable Valve Timing & Lift Electronic Control) is a system developed by Honda to improve the volumetric efficiency of a four-stroke internal combustion engine, resulting in higher performance at high RPM, and lower fuel consumption at low RPM. The VTEC system uses two (or occasionally three) camshaft profiles and hydraulically selects between profiles. It was invented by Honda engineer Ikuo Kajitani.[1][2] It is distinctly different from standard VVT (variable valve timing) systems which change only the valve timings and do not change the camshaft profile or valve lift in any way."
Austin Medina,Lmao
Austin Medina,True
Austin Medina,That is how i talk
Samuel Adams,Austin what do you think about these silly engineers who are cumming their pants over variable displacement
Samuel Adams,Fug bro I dont wanna buy a tractor with 12 cylinders I only need 2
Austin Medina,Lmao wtf is variable displacement how does that work
Samuel Adams,"Essentially that's where you deactivate some of the cylinders on your engine, purportedly for fuel economy"
Austin Medina,Well that makes sense in that case yeah sounds like a decent ide
Austin Medina,Idea
Samuel Adams,The reverse problem is plaguing john deere atm because all of their models ship with the same engine but some are intentionally detuned
Samuel Adams,If you can crack the programming you can literally use the engine at 100% lmao
Samuel Adams,Another classic example of electronics failing to outdo simple mechanics
Austin Medina,Yeah tuning is rly interesting
Austin Medina,Like a lot of ppl dont know you cant just slap an exhaust intake and headers on and expect a big gain you need a tune for the computer to direct the components to properly use those new features to make more power
Austin Medina,"And like same shit with fuel injectors, turbos all that kind of stuff"
Samuel Adams,Fuck ever since I really started getting into cars I despair at the state of the modern car industry
Samuel Adams,What happened
Samuel Adams,Planned obsolescense has crept its way into every facet of the production process
Austin Medina,Theyre becoming a bunch of money hungry scumbags
Samuel Adams,It doesn't help that GM and Ford have essentially an oligopoly on the north american market and can basically do whatever the fuck they want
Samuel Adams,I am fully redpilled on our japanese saviors
Austin Medina,"Japanese and korean cars are truly superior in a lot of ways, americans have them beat in terms of quality towing and hauling and stuff like that but ye"
Austin Medina,Gm ford and chrysler have their bright spots
Elijah Parker,ð®ðª
Elijah Parker,It's actually a good thing I didn't get a guitar boyos
Degan Nestrichal,wait this isnt eli he forgot the period
Elijah Parker,Job Corps only lets you have small instruments.
Samuel Adams,Why's that?
Samuel Adams,Oh fuk
Elijah Parker,She said my ukulele should be fine but I'm probably gonna get a harmonica just in case.
Austin Medina,Smh
Degan Nestrichal,good thing u didnt buy that 12 piece drum set for $5 on craigslist ð
Austin Medina,When are you gonna officially start eli
Elijah Parker,Still not sure honestly.
Samuel Adams,Eli gonna become a master of harmonica and play some blues solos for us
Elijah Parker,Banjos seem cool but I could never see me playing one.
Degan Nestrichal,job corps kinda seems like nazi germany elijah
Degan Nestrichal,and u look like a jew
Degan Nestrichal,so :o
Samuel Adams,Lmao
Elijah Parker,I'm also the only Aryan in the group too tho.
Degan Nestrichal,fk dats true
Samuel Adams,Juergen is technically here
Degan Nestrichal,@Juergen Zuelow
Elijah Parker,Okay I'm the only active Aryan in the group.
Samuel Adams,"Although he works at our discord affiliate, Our First President George W Bush!"
Elijah Parker,Honestly I might just get a harmonica even if I can bring my ukulele.
Elijah Parker,I can just put it in the zipper pouch of my ukulele's gig bag ez
Degan Nestrichal,what else r u not allowed to have at job corps
Elijah Parker,Drugs.
Samuel Adams,"A suitable income, a place to sleep that's up to code"
Elijah Parker,Nah but really they're pretty lax it's just because I've already gotta share the room with 1 to 3 other people so they need to make sure we all can use the right amount of space.
Elijah Parker,Hence why it's small instruments.
Degan Nestrichal,so ur gonna be unable to smoke?
Elijah Parker,Weed yeah.
Elijah Parker,Ciggies no more than likely.
Elijah Parker,They've got a new like. Headmaster I think is what they're called.
Elijah Parker,So ciggies I can't be for sure on but they've been allowed with every other headmaster.
Samuel Adams,"And if not, this is a good excuse to get off nicotine at least for a while lol"
Elijah Parker,That's true.
Samuel Adams,Although I guarantee at least one other person in job corps is gonna have a vape of some kind
Elijah Parker,Oh yeah probably.
Elijah Parker,So basically what I'm thinking is since I get paid for doing job corps training I'll have to be buying like bars of soap and deodorant and such. But with the rest I'm gonna save it for another instrument lol
Elijah Parker,A harp maybe. Definitely a guitar tho.
Elijah Parker,I wouldn't be able to bring it to job corps but I can have it at home.
Samuel Adams,In my humble opinion harps are quite gimmicky
Elijah Parker,What do you mean?
Samuel Adams,You can easily duplicate the sound with a synth/midi controller but you'd need a computer of some kind for that
Elijah Parker,Well if that's the case then fuck the harp.
Samuel Adams,"Well, the cost of a harp is not worth having one as opposed to just being able to ""play"" one via a keyboard"
Elijah Parker,Not even like.
Elijah Parker,50 bucks?
Samuel Adams,Same reason I can play whole string symphonies and flutes and such on my laptop
Samuel Adams,"Well for 50 bucks you can't lose much anyway, but I don't know what competitive prices for lyres or harps are lmao"
Elijah Parker,Oh bro they can get hella expensive.
Elijah Parker,But that's not ya boi.
Samuel Adams,I have a keyboard in my basement that's technically a midi controller
Elijah Parker,The most I'd pay for an instrument I don't know how to play I'm just interested in is like a hundo.
Samuel Adams,"I kinda regret getting a midi controller but I don't at the same time, it's just because I don't use it nearly enough"
Elijah Parker,I mean you're never home.
Elijah Parker,You live on campus lol.
Samuel Adams,"That's true, and I've never really set aside time to focus on playing keys"
Elijah Parker,Bro you could learn the keys while I learn the harp.
Elijah Parker,ð
Samuel Adams,I moreso regret purchasing it in comparison to a synth because I have to go through the hassle of setting it up properly whereas a synth would produce its own sounds without having to be connected to something else
Elijah Parker,What is a synth?
Samuel Adams,"But it's fine, I technically have more access to shit this way once it's actually set up"
Elijah Parker,I was thinking you meant a synthetic keyboard. Like a fake piano.
Samuel Adams,"Nah, a synthesizer"
Elijah Parker,Wait those don't need electricity?
Samuel Adams,Hard to describe but in layman's terms it's just an instrument that generates sound by doing something to audio
Samuel Adams,"No, they do"
Elijah Parker,No I've heard a synth now that you mention it.
Elijah Parker,It sounds kinda sci-fi like?
Samuel Adams,"But a midi controller doesn't produce any of its own sound, it does what it says by basically being an input for a given digital instrument"
Elijah Parker,Like it's hard to explain but it sounds like something you'd see in Star Wars.
Samuel Adams,"That's one way they can sound, theoretically synthesizers can generate an infinite palette of sounds"
Elijah Parker,Holy fuck
Elijah Parker,The ultimate instrument
Samuel Adams,"A lot of people would be inclined to agree, given the state of current music"
Elijah Parker,Realistically it could sound like my ukulele then?
Samuel Adams,"But the synth can't yet replicate (and may never be able to) the timbre of stringed instruments, like a ukelele or guitar"
Elijah Parker,Haha get fucked synth.
Samuel Adams,There's so many subtle nuances in other instruments down to how you pluck a note differently every time that makes it impossible to truly replicate a guitar or something like this
Samuel Adams,The synth does best when it plays synth stuff and doesn't try to emulate other instruments
Samuel Adams,"Although, that's a good starting point and you can get some cool sounds of it"
Elijah Parker,So why would the midi be able to replicate a harp?
Elijah Parker,I'd have to get an electric harp to plug it in no?
Samuel Adams,Because a harp isn't as complex as a guitar and we can get closer to the sound of a harp just on that fact alone
Samuel Adams,"There's no fretting on a harp for example, every note is going to be the same when you play a given string"
Elijah Parker,So wait.
Elijah Parker,If I just strummed my ukulele it would be able to emulate it?
Samuel Adams,"Well, on a technicality, yes, if you sampled the ukulele and mapped it to the keys you could do this"
Elijah Parker,:0:0
Samuel Adams,However it'd sound artificial as it tries to pitch up and down your ukulele
Elijah Parker,Ahhhhhhhh that's different.
Samuel Adams,"You can do this on garageband with any sound, like you can record yourself screaming and it'll keep the original recording at middle C"
Elijah Parker,Lmao that would be funny.
Samuel Adams,My boys when we all convene in my basement I will bust out the synth plugins for my keyboard
Elijah Parker,I'll bring my ukulele.
Samuel Adams,Me and Austin will play some jazzy 5/4 shit
Samuel Adams,Feat Eli on uke and J on guitar
Elijah Parker,You could show me what you mean when you talk about hitting the frets when I strum.
Samuel Adams,J what kinda shit have you been learning on guitar lately
Samuel Adams,Fuck who forgot to take Chris off of the payroll
Elijah Parker,Fuck!
Samuel Adams,He's still earning royalties from millennium riot recordings!
Elijah Parker,No wonder we're all so broke!
Samuel Adams,This person tried to unlock your iPhone
J Cole Patt,Hes trying to fuck you
Elijah Parker,:0:0
Samuel Adams,Flashback to when Eli busted down the bathroom door
Elijah Parker,Fuck you
Samuel Adams,5 short years ago you and Chris were trading yaoi pictures
Samuel Adams,Look at how far we've come
Samuel Adams,"Actually fuck, yeah it was like 5 years ago lmao I think February of 2016 was the first time we got the boys together at J's grandparents place"
Samuel Adams,Strange to think so much personal history revolves around that space
J Cole Patt,They do have a whole place to play in the basement.
Elijah Parker,I'll bring my ukulele
J Cole Patt,"all in all though, u gotta get a electric ukelele"
Elijah Parker,I gotta learn to actually play the ukulele before I get another one
Degan Nestrichal,i like how i just say austin is a milf banger and the AI generates a story on him being a MAP
Elijah Parker,Lmao get fucked Austin
Degan Nestrichal,"the bold part is what i typed in, the rest is what the AI generated"
Elijah Parker,The AI said fuck your whole idea he's a MAP
Degan Nestrichal,they know austin personally
Elijah Parker,Lmfao
Degan Nestrichal,man im fked for this midterm i should just get drunk
Elijah Parker,Nah nigga study then get drunk

Elijah Parker,blessed be my niggas lmao
Austin Medina,Why are the niggars in Paris
Samuel Adams,You don't necessarily need an electric uke if we just mic it up lol
Austin Medina,You know theyre from uk lmoa

Elijah Parker,Maybe meeting her friends in the park or something idk.
Austin Medina,That's whats up
Elijah Parker,I've only ever been there once before so that's the main reason we're going.
J Cole Patt,"Hey @Degan Nestrichal
I have some computer questions, hmu."
Elijah Parker,"Hey @Degan Nestrichal

Elijah Parker,That's another thing that confuses me.
Elijah Parker,Like. All of us grew up around computers and understanding the internet at least a little. That's legit like the oldest trick in the book.
Elijah Parker,"It's just a Nigerian Prince swapped out to some rando in ""government"""
J Cole Patt,Lets not make fun of randes suffering.
Elijah Parker,I'm not. I'm wondering how he fell for it.
Austin Medina,Seriously bro these mfs sent a stock image of a bunch of FedEx trucks leaving a shipping area like what the fuc how do you not realize

Austin Medina,Whats her twitch @
Degan Nestrichal,soulsticeisabsent
Austin Medina,Im gonna orbit her
Samuel Adams,When Drake asks you out at an ice skating rink despite having never talked to you before
Austin Medina,Did that happen
Samuel Adams,Lmao yes
Samuel Adams,Drake also conspired to ask out Cece Hund on the last day of school except he failed to acknowledge that she was going to move to Iowa immediately after school was over
Austin Medina,LMAO
Austin Medina,Nigga sounds like a real winner
Austin Medina,That shits funny thank u edd
Samuel Adams,Why would you share this? You're just giving him a platform smh

Elijah Parker,Sounds about right.
Austin Medina,The chevy c10 doesnt even run
Austin Medina,Its clean as fuck tho its from texas my friend was trying to fix it up but it just refuses to turn on now
Elijah Parker,Maybe take it to a mechanic?
Austin Medina,They tried that lol
Elijah Parker,Maybe take it to a better mechanic?
Austin Medina,He brought it here to see if they could get it to start but it would have been more than the worth of the truck to figure out why it wont start so hes just gonna sell it to someone for cheap
Samuel Adams,Dude Eddie's so attractive in this picture!
Elijah Parker,I'm p tired lol
Degan Nestrichal,go to sleep then dam bruh chill shit bruh quit fkin us up fk dude
Elijah Parker,Fk u bro!

J Cole Patt,beutifol
Samuel Adams,"Goodbye, My Darling!"
Samuel Adams,"Guys I just realized if Caleb is endorsing the Super Straight movement, that makes him an SS soldier!"
J Cole Patt,"As a Great american youth community, we must eliminate the super straight movement."
Samuel Adams,GAY > SS
Samuel Adams,Even @JJ Joseph can get behind this sentiment!
J Cole Patt,If you guys would like to come over I can make us this for our drunken morning if youd like.
J Cole Patt,"I get off on saturday like,"
J Cole Patt,idk afternoon i think
Samuel Adams,Sunday's always weird for me because I gotta get back to Marquette

Samuel Adams,Exhibit 1A for why long hair is great
Austin Medina,Damn this nigga sexy
Samuel Adams,I will now become a NEET and never get it cut
Elijah Parker,can I be exbit 14D for why long hair is gud?
Austin Medina,Sam is going to be a hippie HR rep it's going to be so cool
Samuel Adams,Eli you can be whatever you want to be sweetheart ð©
Degan Nestrichal,long hair is gay because its symbolic of something your girlfriend can tug on while she pegs you!
Austin Medina,Im goin for a drive on my lunch
Degan Nestrichal,that londons reaction to austin going on a drive for lunch
Samuel Adams,Fuck!
Austin Medina,Love this mufuckin car i put in ten bucks and got damn near a half tank
Elijah Parker,are you listening to deadmau5 rn
Austin Medina,Ye
Samuel Adams,Never forget this is the most powerful video currently on the internet
Samuel Adams,As of march 4th this was 4 years ago kek
Austin Medina,Practice fucking horrible
Samuel Adams,Lord have mercy we were 16 years old
Austin Medina,Im listing my civic for sale if anyone knows a friend that can drive stick and wants 8t
Austin Medina,It*
J Cole Patt,ð®ðª
Samuel Adams,What's the next racecar lmao
Samuel Adams,"""I love this car""
58 minutes later
""I'm gonna sell it"""
Austin Medina,I do love this car but I want to see how much I can get for it
J Cole Patt,lmao
Austin Medina,Preferably integra or miata for next fun car
J Cole Patt,"""Ill give u 4k"" 
""Ah cool thx c ya, i just wanted to know how much i can get for it."""
Austin Medina,If i got 4k that would be ridiculous im looking for like 2500
Samuel Adams,The floorboard LEDs are worth 3k alone
Austin Medina,I took that out lmao
Austin Medina,Kind of cringe
Austin Medina,"But i mean its a great car for saving gas and its fun as hell to drive since its loud and its manual, has nice wheels and all that"
Samuel Adams,Get a Miata
Austin Medina,I would theyre pretty pricey
Degan Nestrichal,austin teach me how to drive manny
Austin Medina,Buy my civic and i will
Degan Nestrichal,lol ill give u my forenza bro its an even trade
Degan Nestrichal,considering the civic is manual it probably is worth even more XD
Samuel Adams,Eddie I'll teach you how to drive stick and I won't charge you because I don't believe in capital gains!
Degan Nestrichal,i mean i can follow a youtube tutorial but thats not fun
Degan Nestrichal,need someone who has xp
Austin Medina,You wanna get a manual car someday or just wanna know to know
Degan Nestrichal,dont wanna get carjacked in the hood!
Austin Medina,Lmao fair
Austin Medina,I can teach you but i dont rly wanna do it on my car incase you destroy the trans or clutch
Degan Nestrichal,fk poor engineering huh u can break the trans and clutch that easy huh?
Samuel Adams,Manuals are obsolete and none of us will ever be rich enough to afford a car that's only made with a manual transmission don't worry
Austin Medina,"Lol wym rich enough, base model cars come with manuals to save money"
Degan Nestrichal,u ever have a weird time switching from manual to auto austin? since obv u have muscle memory for each car
Samuel Adams,Read my message again kek
Austin Medina,Wym
Degan Nestrichal,austin just bought the civic to learn manual now he wants out!
Austin Medina,Yeah sometimes i get in and put my left foot down to hit the clutch when starting it lmao
Austin Medina,But manuals arent obsolete in the slightest imo
Samuel Adams,Aw shid I traded up and I'm gonna get this guy's Mclaren P1 tomorrow pog
Austin Medina,P1nus
Degan Nestrichal,is it really that easy for a beginner to fk up the transmission or clutch
Austin Medina,This kind of depends how fast you catch on I still might destroy my transmission I'm not sure we'll see
Degan Nestrichal,how bout i watch a YT video on it then u teach me saturday?
Austin Medina,If you find somebody else's car to use I will do that
Samuel Adams,You'd have to really fuck up I think unless his trans is already brittle
Austin Medina,If my trans is that brutal I would have destroyed it by now because I fucked up pretty bad at some points
Samuel Adams,Basically at a certain rev it will catch *some* gear but it might grind like a bastard getting there
Degan Nestrichal,well i dont have any manual cars at my disposal austin
Austin Medina,That sucks
Samuel Adams,Lmao let's take my dad's focus out for a spin
Austin Medina,If he dont care ð¤£ð¤£ð¤£
Austin Medina,Im down
Austin Medina,So glad i didnt sell when i was down like 20 percent overall
Austin Medina,Its been a rly good day
Samuel Adams,Only problem with manuals I can foresee is managing hills
Samuel Adams,And maybe getting it going in the first place but shifting gears is a simple concept
Austin Medina,Theres a lot more to it than u think
Austin Medina,How do u slow down sem
Samuel Adams,Well you gotta downshift or otherwise you're gonna have a hard time kek
Degan Nestrichal,start with an automatic first faggot!
Austin Medina,Correct
Austin Medina,But you gotta manage to do it without jerking the car so what i do is double clutch
Samuel Adams,I have been the target of much faithless rhetoric lately and it amuses me
Austin Medina,You start on manual if you find someone to teach you
Samuel Adams,"You will not faze me, you son of a bitch!"
Austin Medina,My friend lucas did that he was 16 and learned to drive on a manual car
Degan Nestrichal,manual seems like more hassle for little reward
Samuel Adams,That's true until Austin gets shitfaced and you have to drive his car home for him!
Austin Medina,Its just rly fun to me
Degan Nestrichal,so you upshift gears to go faster at higher rpms?
Degan Nestrichal,idk this one tutorial vid i found online is shitty
Austin Medina,Yeah higher gear lets u get to a higher top speed
Austin Medina,And then when youre slowing down you gotta try to downshift or shift into neutral and coast
Samuel Adams,I think my dad regularly gets his car going from second at least when he's at intersections
Austin Medina,Yeah you can start in 2nd idk what the point is tho
Degan Nestrichal,"automatic be like: brake to slow down, gas to accelerate!"
Austin Medina,Yep
Degan Nestrichal,u passed ur drivers test!
Austin Medina,U still have brakes obviously its just if youre in 5th gear and brake down to a low speed the engine will stall and youre dead in the water
Austin Medina,"At that point you gotta put the car in first, push the clutch pedal in and restart the engine and go from there"
Austin Medina,"That goes for any gear if you go too slow in first itll stall, usually if you need to completely stop you put it into neutral like at a stop light"
Degan Nestrichal,wtf do u mean by double clutch
Degan Nestrichal,this mf putting two feet on his clutch pedal? ð
Samuel Adams,You basically use neutral as a middle ground while you get the rpm up to where it should be I think
Degan Nestrichal,let the professional austin do the talking sam!
Samuel Adams,This mf gonna be so mad when he finds out I'm right! xD
Samuel Adams,"I know more about this than you do and I don't even have a license! Get up to speed loser! Pun not intended, since clearly you can't get a manual up to speed! LMAO!"
Austin Medina,"Nah right so lets say youre slowing down and you gotta go from 4th to 3rd, what i do if im going at certain speeds and need to get into 3rd is ill push in the clutch, pull the shifter into neutral, blip the throttle so like rev it up to about 4k rpms, push the clutch back in and put it into 3rd gear so by the time i put it back into gear and by the time the revs fall its in the perfect rpm range"
Degan Nestrichal,austin has big dick practical/technical knowledge instead of dumb libtard book knowledge! lmao!
Austin Medina,And the clutch will catch
Austin Medina,Lmao i just like cars
Austin Medina,"But so basically the point of doing that is to smoothly transition through the gears, if you just down shift without rev matching the car will jerk when you disengage the clutch"
Degan Nestrichal,auto drivers with their engine rpm scale be like: what am i supposed to do with this?
Austin Medina,It also sounds cool
Austin Medina,Lmao
Austin Medina,Well some automatic cars have manual modes like paddle shifters and stuff like that where knowing the rpm matters
Samuel Adams,I'm kinda confused why you would rev up the engine to downshift
Samuel Adams,Isn't the point to bring the engine speed down lol
Degan Nestrichal,"you see all this talking does nothing, hands-on knowledge for any skill is the only thing that helps"
Austin Medina,Because the drive wheels are traveling faster than the engine is spinning so if you connect them the engine will rev up anyway the only difference is you wont get that jarring jerking
Samuel Adams,Austin have you ever float shifted your civic
Austin Medina,The fuck does that mean
Samuel Adams,Almost like semi-double clutching
Samuel Adams,"You shift into neutral, bring the rpm up to where it should be, and you push the gear in without pressing the clutch"
Samuel Adams,"I think you have to do this if you ever want to get a CDL, be warned future truck drivers!"
Austin Medina,What sounds like a way to blow up your trans to me
Degan Nestrichal,"fug bro just got done reading about how An algorithm is said to run in sub-linear time (often spelled sublinear time) if T(n) = o(n). In particular this includes algorithms with the time complexities defined above.

Typical algorithms that are exact and yet run in sub-linear time use parallel processing (as the NC1 matrix determinant calculation does), or alternatively have guaranteed assumptions on the input structure (as the logarithmic time binary search and many tree maintenance algorithms do). However, formal languages such as the set of all strings that have a 1-bit in the position indicated by the first log(n) bits of the string may depend on every bit of the input and yet be computable in sub-linear time.

The specific term sublinear time algorithm is usually reserved to algorithms that are unlike the above in that they are run over classical serial machine models and are not allowed prior assumptions on the input.[8] They are however allowed to be randomized, and indeed must be randomized for all but the most trivial of tasks.

As such an algorithm must provide an answer without reading the entire input, its particulars heavily depend on the access allowed to the input. Usually for an input that is represented as a binary string b1,...,bk it is assumed that the algorithm can in time O(1) request and obtain the value of bi for any i.

Sub-linear time algorithms are typically randomized, and provide only approximate solutions. In fact, the property of a binary string having only zeros (and no ones) can be easily proved not to be decidable by a (non-approximate) sub-linear time algorithm. Sub-linear time algorithms arise naturally in the investigation of property testing."
Austin Medina,Youre not supposed to really put a car into or out of gear without the clutch pedal pushed in
Austin Medina,It might be different for truck drivers though my grandpa said he knows how to drive stick without a clutch so I don't know
Austin Medina,Do u know what power shifting is
Samuel Adams,"It's moreso for truck drivers yeah, for long hauls because it's easier on your legs"
Samuel Adams,Doesn't necessarily extend the life of the clutch any
Austin Medina,Power shifting is shifting with your foot firmly pushing the throttle all the way in lmao
Austin Medina,So you just keep giving it gas
Samuel Adams,Aw fug bro just did a power float double clutch shift and my transmission fell out
Austin Medina,Fell out lel
Degan Nestrichal,automatic is more large brain
Degan Nestrichal,with manual you actually have to think
Degan Nestrichal,automatic u can be solving calculus problems in ur head while driving
Degan Nestrichal,or debugging ur program
Samuel Adams,Richard Feynman be like
Degan Nestrichal,therefore automatic is more large brain
Degan Nestrichal,why drive manual when u can learn how to make a million dollars in ur basement? basically ur fucking stupid
Degan Nestrichal,ah shit bro i gotta slow down lemme remember the 7-step algorithm that austin taught me
Degan Nestrichal,"i feel like its autistic to express this stuff over text, its probably a lot simpler hands-on"
Austin Medina,Yeah you can learn i would just say you should find a car to learn on first that is not mineð³ð³
Degan Nestrichal,fuck some girl refused caleb sex again!
Degan Nestrichal,how dare she transfer the pain to him
Austin Medina,Kek
Samuel Adams,Austin he's gonna buy the car off of you and make you watch as he destroys the transmission
Austin Medina,Idgaf as long as i get cash money
Samuel Adams,"Actually his meta plan is to convince you to test drive the civic, badly damage the transmission, and then buy it off of you for dirt cheap"
Samuel Adams,"Eddie knows a guy he can get it fixed, the world is his to command ð¥´"
Austin Medina,I wonder how that works if theres any protection if say someone crashes on your test drive
Austin Medina,Hey id like to test drive this audi oops i blew the motor ill give you 500 for it
Austin Medina,Ez part out to make money
Samuel Adams,"It was an Audi, it wasn't destined to last very long anyway"
Samuel Adams,Thank you for this helpful tutorial video Eddie! I will study this for my drivers test!
Austin Medina,If you put a manual car in reverse and let the clutch out all the way while giving it a bit of gas itll go rly rly fast in reverse
Austin Medina,So u gotta hold the clutch in like half way
Degan Nestrichal,i hope sam passes his drivers test now
Austin Medina,Fuck i just blew out a customers tire by hitting a curb LMAO
Austin Medina,Theyre not mad i just feel retarded
Samuel Adams,Lmao holy shit
Samuel Adams,That was bound to burst no matter what you did
Austin Medina,That shit explodied
Elijah Parker,did u feel it bump?

Samuel Adams,"Guys help, I'm locked up at the county jail and the only bail they accept is a used Eastwood Mandocaster Sunburst Electric Mandolin in a Donner 28 inch Mandolin Gig Bag!"
J Cole Patt,why does that guitar look like it has down syndrome?
Samuel Adams,"Look, they told me you get a discount if you buy the disabled one"
Samuel Adams,I can't pass that up :(
Elijah Parker,Sam it's okay bro! You can have my gig bag if that's all they'll take!
Elijah Parker,It's 16 wide by 40 long.
Elijah Parker,Wait lmao
Elijah Parker,I think my ukulele bag is probably close to 28 inches.
Elijah Parker,It's several inches longer than my actual ukulele.
Samuel Adams,I imagine a ukulele is about 75% the size of this instrument
Elijah Parker,Smol guitar.
Samuel Adams,"Funny thing is I still haven't actually seen it in person, I will tomorrow"
Elijah Parker,I can't wait to hear how it sounds laddie.
Samuel Adams,Gonna learn some mf Irish pub songs
Elijah Parker,I approve whole heartedly.
Samuel Adams,Learning mandolin isn't going to be difficult but I don't think there's nearly as many resources for it as there are for guitar or ukulele
Samuel Adams,"Mandolin is arguably the first instrument I own that is not a ""normie"" instrument lmao"
Elijah Parker,Would you count a lute as a normie instrument sammy?
Samuel Adams,Although a MIDI controller is pretty esoteric especially if you buy it thinking it's going to be a keyboard that produces its own sound
Samuel Adams,Not at all
Samuel Adams,"I'd say guitar, bass, drums, and keys cover 80% of people"
Elijah Parker,What about a ukulele?
Samuel Adams,"The other 20% is symphonic instruments and things like mandolins, saxophone, etc"
Samuel Adams,Ukulele is hard to define but I think it's more of an accessible instrument than anything
Samuel Adams,"Not expensive, easy to learn, a decent presence in popular music"
Elijah Parker,"Oh yeah bro it's cheap, sounds nice, smol and easy to play."
Austin Medina,Im gonna one up sam and learn to play the didgeridoo
Samuel Adams,Fuck
Elijah Parker,That would be massive dick chad Sam's final form.
Samuel Adams,Bagpipes time
Elijah Parker,Unironically I fucking love the bag pipes lmao.
Elijah Parker,There was a time when I was real little I wanted to learn how to play.
Elijah Parker,Fuck with the nose flute boys.
Samuel Adams,I think learning cello would be fucking sick
Elijah Parker,Deadass.
Elijah Parker,Cello sounds so nice.
Elijah Parker,If I was gonna learn a band instrument though I'd be a clarinet or sax.
Elijah Parker,Sax counts as a band instrument yeah?
Samuel Adams,Yes
Samuel Adams,Saxophone occupies a weird middle ground from what I remember
Elijah Parker,Saxophones are sweet. Fuckin Kenny G and jazz bro.
Austin Medina,We gonna chill this weekend?
Elijah Parker,Saturday I'm gonna be busy.
J Cole Patt,"Yes, i shall be getting sum drank as well"
Austin Medina,Okay sounds good
Elijah Parker,Saturday is London and I's 1 month lads. Probably gonna take her out to dinner.

Elijah Parker,I just got stopped by the cops on a walk for baring a passing resemblance to a guy named Randon
J Cole Patt,Uh
J Cole Patt,Dont snitch on my boy.
Elijah Parker,I didn't.
J Cole Patt,Gucci
Elijah Parker,I just said nah I'm not rande and told them my name.
J Cole Patt,If its Randon it aint my boy
J Cole Patt,if its Randen maybe.
Elijah Parker,They didn't spell it out they just said randon. It could be randen for all I know they sound similar.
Elijah Parker,Why would I snitch on rande and for what either J? You mad man.
Degan Nestrichal,how u confuse eli and rande what a dumb cop
Elijah Parker,Height and color maybe?
Elijah Parker,General age as well.
J Cole Patt,Nah u snitchin

Elijah Parker,lmao fuk
Degan Nestrichal,this friend group is made of 20 year olds who act 14

Elijah Parker,Smh
Degan Nestrichal,heard that the cops can be brutal to aryan men. they start rubbing their dick and kissing them
Elijah Parker,Bro maybe they'll lick me nips
Elijah Parker,The issue was I ofc had weed in me pocket
Austin Medina,o shit good thing they didnt try to search u
Samuel Adams,Been there lmao
Austin Medina,true
Samuel Adams,âWhy are y'all parked at a closed beachâ
Samuel Adams,I was shitting myself
Austin Medina,were not smoking weed thats for sure officer
Elijah Parker,Us 20 year old white boys and our weed.
Samuel Adams,If they asked to search me I'd be foked
Elijah Parker,Same
Elijah Parker,I've got weed and no ID on me.
Austin Medina,and i would have reacted as not knowing you had weed but of course they wouldnt believe me although i was ignorant as to the fact there was weed in the car
Samuel Adams,And if drunk belligerent Eli had come with us we would've been really fucked
Samuel Adams,You were beyond saving that night Eli lmao
Samuel Adams,Hard to believe it all happened on one night
Elijah Parker,That's accurate.
Austin Medina,that was a weird night
J Cole Patt,Cops are so easy to deal with but honestly jts only cause they dont want a hard time.
J Cole Patt,If they dont know about anything theyd prefer it.
Samuel Adams,Kinda suspect that they stop Eli to ask about a guy named randen
Austin Medina,yeah what if they werent cops
Samuel Adams,The odds are ridiculous that they would stop one of Rande's friends
Samuel Adams,"That, or they've been keeping tabs on all of rande's friends which is even weirder/more concerning"
Austin Medina,i hope i dont get stopped lmfao imma be like sorry no but they know i know him because theyre watching rn
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, I mean there's no fucking way in a city with 100k people you confuse two people who look nothing alike and happen to know each other"
Samuel Adams,That's very suspicious
Samuel Adams,Maybe they said Brandon and you just didn't hear the B? Lmao
Austin Medina,damn keno is 100k people wtf
Degan Nestrichal,what is this dystopia
Austin Medina,caitlyn jenner
Elijah Parker,Nah because they asked for Randy/Rande first
Elijah Parker,Then said Randon/Randen
Austin Medina,thats really sus
Elijah Parker,I agree bro it was spooky.
Elijah Parker,They definitely were cops though. I was talking to the one through the passenger window and that computer had me in it. Idk how because I've never spoken to the cops besides my cousin and that one other cop not too long ago but he didn't get my name or date of birth. Nor did he ask me if I've ever been arrested.
Austin Medina,thats weird as fuck
Elijah Parker,I agree but it was definitely real police.

Samuel Adams,Just make sure your credit score is decent too or they'll say sorry you can't pay a 700 a month mortgage you're better off paying 1500 a month in rent
Degan Nestrichal,austin left the chat cuz he knew his monthly income was cap! unless this dude counting his dividends and porno shooting revenues!
Austin Medina,Nah thats accurate
Samuel Adams,All this adult talk is exhausting
Austin Medina,I mean i do work at least 6 hours of ot each week thats not too bad tho
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna die before I have to have any real responsibilities because that's the right thing to do
Austin Medina,Working is really not bad just be a good dude and make some friends itll help to get by
Degan Nestrichal,"sam is just mad autistic with all of this book knowledge but no practical knowledge of working ððð its called information overload dumbass, ever heard of it ðððð¤£ð¤£ð¤£"

J Cole Patt,rip to him eh
Austin Medina,nah bruh i broke some clips on the honda had to go buy some new ones

Elijah Parker,ð®ðª
Austin Medina,How u guys dojn
Samuel Adams,We are chilling
Samuel Adams,Gonna head back to marquette in a few hours
Austin Medina,Nice
Samuel Adams,Fuk man college is starting to become a drag why can't I just skip to the part where I make money and/or play live music
Samuel Adams,"Still, can't beat the rampant socialization that college offers kek"
Austin Medina,You could but you wont have something to fall back on
Austin Medina,Man this summer is gonna be good but holy fuck summer 2022 gonna go hard were all gonna be 21
Austin Medina,And im sure youll have had a job by then and got some cash stacked same for eddie and j and eli we can plan some fun shit for the weekends or even a trip barring covid
Samuel Adams,I'm just gonna drive out to the rockies and discover who I am
Austin Medina,Whatever u gotta do bro
Austin Medina,"My coworker mark did that, when he got out the army he just drove way up north into wisconsin and got a job and lived there for a while, rented a room from some people and just lived his life"
Austin Medina,And then came back and resumed what he had planned getting a wife house and kids lmao
Austin Medina,If you throw yourself into the fire youll learn really fast that you have what it takes to achieve most things that seem way out of your realm of ability
Austin Medina,Like when i worked for ben i went in scared shitless and then after about 3 months it just became the norm
Samuel Adams,I figure I can do most things but when it comes to jobs it's about someone else trusting you to be able to do it and not necessarily having the patience to wait for you to get good at it lol
Austin Medina,"Thats why you gotta start small, take on a bit of responsibility so youre not in over your head and when you gain that foundation of being reliable and on time and wanting something more, thats when youll feel confident and have that drive to take on more responsibility"
Austin Medina,"If you show up and try hard to get better at what you want to do, most people wont get impatient with it"
Austin Medina,"Think about how many stupid assholes probably have great jobs and itll make you feel a bit more qualified and capable, same with driving i see so many dumb mfs driving that im like yeah im not worried about being bad when theres so much worse out there"
Samuel Adams,I know a lot of promotion and advancement is done through general asskissing so yeah that's not a big deal lol
Austin Medina,"Kind of, I've been trying to avoid that shit and let my work speak for me, my service advisors will vouch for me even though they dont want me to get promoted because i hustle when shit gets hairy"
Samuel Adams,Austin is the best at popping customers' tires! I recommend he be promoted immediately!
Austin Medina,"Ah shit bro i just accidentally slashed ur tire, thats gonna be 250 bucks for parts and labor"
Austin Medina,Just be a porter at a kenosha dealership if the commute is too bad for u
Austin Medina,All u gotta know how to do is drive and push a rag on a car
Austin Medina,Or work at uline with edward
Austin Medina,If i move to madison with eddie ill just be a warehouse wageslave!
Samuel Adams,You'll be a warehouse wageslave but you'll be free to drunkenly drown in many of Madison's finest lakes! Think of the possibilities!
Austin Medina,lmao
Austin Medina,maybe i should just spend this stimmy check on shit the government hates since im already doing an exhaust upgrade
Austin Medina,just buy a fuckin rifle too while im at it
JJ Joseph,"@Austin Medina  depends on what rifle an ar is good if you can an 80% lower is a good option and then you can hand pick your upper, trigger system, bolt carrier etc but ammo is still quite expensive atm"
Austin Medina,"not sure exactly what i would want, either an ar or i might just wait till october when im 21 and get a pistol"
JJ Joseph,But 5.56/.223 is the cheapest intermediate cartridges
JJ Joseph,Well what pistol would you get
Austin Medina,probably a 9mil
JJ Joseph,Are you thinking like budget highpoint or something else
Austin Medina,just want something reliable and relatively inexpensive as a first gun
J Cole Patt,good luck
JJ Joseph,Well highpoints are the cheapest out there and there quite reliable
JJ Joseph,But very ugly and can be uncomfortable
Austin Medina,"what would be an example, not too familiar"
JJ Joseph,A high point is the brand there most recent 9 that I remember they had a name contest so it's called the yeet cannon
Austin Medina,"lmao thats sick, ill look into"
Austin Medina,is it hi-point?
JJ Joseph,High powers are nice
JJ Joseph,Ya I believe so
Austin Medina,ok i found the site
JJ Joseph,Down side is I believe all hipoints are single stack
JJ Joseph,So you have a thinner grip but less space for rounds
JJ Joseph,Downside about high-power is it's not in production anymore but still a good gun
JJ Joseph,Don't get a beretta
JJ Joseph,Uhh glocks are fine but there a bit over blown
JJ Joseph,Sig had some good hand guns
JJ Joseph,Has*
Austin Medina,imma go to my local ranges too and see what they got
JJ Joseph,Or you could get an ar pistol
JJ Joseph,Five star didn't sell I'm pretty sure
JJ Joseph,Doesn't
Austin Medina,wym?
JJ Joseph,They don't sell guns
Austin Medina,pretty sure they do i was there not too long ago
JJ Joseph,You can check but that's what I heard
JJ Joseph,You can rent
Austin Medina,unless they recently stopped for some reason
JJ Joseph,But I don't think you can buy
JJ Joseph,I checked the website it talked about custom parts but I didn't see anything about selling guns
JJ Joseph,The range in waukegan sells guns tho
JJ Joseph,It's on washington
JJ Joseph,And again you can rent a firearm to shoot
JJ Joseph,@Austin Medina
JJ Joseph,Oh I forgot to mention you could also get an ar pistol too
Samuel Adams,Man fuck playing drums that shit is hard
Samuel Adams,If we don't find a competent drummer I'm gonna Kim's
Austin Medina,good arm work out tho
Austin Medina,"if we wanna plan something for next weekend i am once again down, i can pick up sam if need be"
Austin Medina,"if that stimmy hits i might be working on the civic again two weekends from now, because shipping"
Degan Nestrichal,bet u limp dick faggots could never dream of having a desktop this riced out!

Samuel Adams,Wait I don't see it where did you reference hom lol
Elijah Parker,I wanna get a moped :):):)
Austin Medina,i was thinking about getting a bike that seems like it would be fun
Austin Medina,"mopeds are a good option too tho cuz motorcylces are generally too fast for their own good, you can really hurt or kill yourself with a motorcycle lmao"
Degan Nestrichal,look at the status bar at the top
Degan Nestrichal,on the left
Samuel Adams,Oh fuk
Samuel Adams,"This was taken in 2021, HOM wasn't released until 2023!"
Samuel Adams,Not sure I'll ever release hom I gotta work on it
J Cole Patt,Im going to be getting vaccinated.
J Cole Patt,This friday
J Cole Patt,If youd like to come over you might need to get vaccinated as well.
J Cole Patt,At least the way my grandma makes it out to be.
Samuel Adams,How'd you get a vaccine?
J Cole Patt,Racine minoy
J Cole Patt,Get vaccinated nigga
J Cole Patt,Then we play guitar
Samuel Adams,Do you have to be a Racine resident?
Samuel Adams,Oh and you work at jewel my boy I don't think anyone else is eligible atm lmao
J Cole Patt,Try it
J Cole Patt,Say college student or something.
J Cole Patt,You go to classes so getting vaccinated is a advantage.
Degan Nestrichal,say u regularly use ur spit to lube up cocks all across the country so they must vaccinate u
JJ Joseph,Young adults are lowest priority unless your in contact with people especially older people at work or your immunocompromised
Austin Medina,i work at buick dealership the average age of owner is probably about 60
Austin Medina,maybe not 60 but still over 45 is pretty high
Samuel Adams,I'm in close proximity to old professors does that count
Austin Medina,maybe
Austin Medina,cant hurt to try
Samuel Adams,I selfishly want a vaccine so that I can party without repercussions is that so bad
Austin Medina,lol that sounds so shitty when you say it like how it is
Austin Medina,smh :/
Samuel Adams,Other people and their needs don't matter! We're all gonna die anyway!
Austin Medina,we are some selfish faggies
Samuel Adams,"You see Austin, I analyze the ethical considerations of my actions and determine them beneath me"
Samuel Adams,Ethics don't matter if the end is a black nothing! Who's gonna punish me for being a jackass?
Austin Medina,damn ur back to this shit again
Austin Medina,what happened to u
Samuel Adams,Absolutely nothing
Samuel Adams,I never changed
Samuel Adams,I'm not fearful of it now rather it excites me
Samuel Adams,We have to collect as many experiences as possible to get the high score at the end of life
Degan Nestrichal,ur just cursed with overthinking
Elijah Parker,a classic
Degan Nestrichal,after my life was ruined forever i managed to get off heroin for a month
Elijah Parker,ðð»
Samuel Adams,Chad Scotty
Samuel Adams,"Nooooo eli is hitting a vape! At least with cigarettes, he knew what poisonous compounds was killing him!"
Elijah Parker,it lights up and tastes like banana :):):):))::))
Degan Nestrichal,so glad u got a banana-flavored dildo eli :)
Degan Nestrichal,hey dumbasses! upvote this!
Elijah Parker,I trust not
Degan Nestrichal,look at the java program i wrote for this post
Samuel Adams,I upvoted it for the program alone
Degan Nestrichal,lol someones gonna be like damn this guy listens to underground bands how based!
Degan Nestrichal,holy fuck i have 4 upvotes im famous on reddit now!!! holy shit sam the band is gonna take off!
Degan Nestrichal,holy fuck sam im at 10 upcummies!! this is our big break!
Samuel Adams,God take pity on meeeEEeEEe
Samuel Adams,I somehow have 121 songs in the song bank folder
Samuel Adams,When did that happen
Samuel Adams,"Granted, probably only half of these are song-worthy at this point and I think even less have demos or song structures but I've been pumping out lyrics pretty solidly for the past 2 years"
Austin Medina,The sky is purple
Samuel Adams,My supply chain teacher is based
Samuel Adams,Proving once and for all that the Japs have reached the pinnacle of automobile production
Degan Nestrichal,holy fuck sam 78 people might have a half chance about who vestralis is now!
Degan Nestrichal,*knowing
Samuel Adams,Damnit! I need to roll out music immediately to meet this new demand!
Samuel Adams,You know this would be a hell of an advertising campaign
Samuel Adams,"No direct advertisement, just have Vestralis appear in everyday screenshots like Spotify or in a youtube tab where the subject isn't the music"
Samuel Adams,"I'll quietly pay fantano 13 thousand dollars to post a screenshot on his instagram where Vestralis is an open tab! If fantano likes it, it must be good!"
Samuel Adams,CS majors have a poster of this dude and the linux guy in their bedroom!
Degan Nestrichal,its better than the FSF kids who pray to a picture of richard stallman every night before they go to sleep!
Samuel Adams,Lmao this dude looks like tom araya
Samuel Adams,The slayer dude has a side gig endorsing pedophiles and advocating for communism
Degan Nestrichal,"he's weird, guy only uses used thinkpads produced before 2012 since they don't have a proprietary CPU engine"
Degan Nestrichal,doesn't go on websites with proprietary javascript
Samuel Adams,This guy's mind must be as cluttered as his website
Degan Nestrichal,lmao he's a madman
Samuel Adams,John Lennon has truly let himself go
Degan Nestrichal,he gets incredibly offended when people call GNU/Linux just Linux
Degan Nestrichal,he does look like an americanized john lennon if he never got assassinated
Austin Medina,Vestralis blowing up
Austin Medina,Lets go
Samuel Adams,I'd laugh if streaming numbers went up this month because of this post
Austin Medina,I'll start playing in the shuttle car when customers are in so they can hear your tunes
Degan Nestrichal,"remember sam recognition is key, to some it's a necessity"
Samuel Adams,The 4 vestralis songs available to the general public are lame! I can't let people hear it unless it's at its absolute best!
Austin Medina,We need to get together and have dedicated Jam sessions
Samuel Adams,Nothing can happen until we find a drummer I'm utterly convinced
Samuel Adams,I don't wanna play instrument musical chairs lmao
Austin Medina,Okay then how do we find a drummer
Samuel Adams,We sit here and after a while one will be assigned to us by the law of chance
Degan Nestrichal,this is a interview displaying his madness
Austin Medina,What about that guy you met in Michigan
Austin Medina,What's the score live with him for the summer and f****** Jam bro
Austin Medina,Let's just go live with him**
Samuel Adams,Wait do you mean Nick lol
Austin Medina,I forgot his name but sure
Samuel Adams,He's actually trying to get away from michigan afaik
Samuel Adams,Also remember that I can never meet my discord buddies in real life because I cannot spontaneously age 5 years!
Austin Medina,Dude let's just get a f****** apartment for the summer and live our lives
Degan Nestrichal,sam has a lease dummie
Degan Nestrichal,"srsly dummie? r u dum, stupid, or retarded?"
Samuel Adams,"As of last month, I signed my soul away to Marquette University for the third year in a row"
Austin Medina,There's got to be some way we can get this lad to jam with us
Degan Nestrichal,austin bro madison is great for hiking and nature
Samuel Adams,I can't cross the streams kek
Samuel Adams,I've determined I can never properly explain myself as far as my online friends go and those are probably friendships I'll inevitably lose when they realize they've been betrayed for the past 6+ years lmao
Samuel Adams,What else are you lying about you slimy fuck? Huh?!
Austin Medina,Okay well I want this to happen so we need should find a drummer I don't know how it will happen I will look it up online easy fix
Samuel Adams,"I mean, I know Joe plays drums"
Samuel Adams,I've never actually seen him play
Austin Medina,I think that's who I'm talking about you said you met somebody at Marquette this year right that plays drums
Degan Nestrichal,i think i vaguely remember him saying he was not that good
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, I'm actually gonna live with Joe next year lol"
Austin Medina,Well boom I'll just f****** come to Marquette every single weekend and we will be rock gods
Samuel Adams,The only stickler is that he lives in Mequon which could be a trek but if he's willing to make it then kudos
Samuel Adams,"Oh yeah, that too, since the straz music theater should be open again"
Austin Medina,Yeah I think I could work sounds like it would be fun and we can actually maybe put some hole songs together
Samuel Adams,I hope Joe is willing to get fucking metal
Degan Nestrichal,sam do you have ur sc link still or na
Samuel Adams,I haven't heard a lot of these mixes in at least a year
Samuel Adams,Dear god
Degan Nestrichal,thank god i needed something to link for other human beings to listen!
Samuel Adams,Too bad that link is busted!
Degan Nestrichal,no i was kidding!!! bring it back!!
Degan Nestrichal,please this cant be my last time listening to the dank solo in rotting alive or two of a kind!
Samuel Adams,Which one is the dank solo
Degan Nestrichal,6:11 start
Samuel Adams,"Actually, you're right, that fits the vibe of the song better I think"
Samuel Adams,The one in the most recent version is just me kinda dicking around and depending on the wall of sound to accomplish the rest
Samuel Adams,"I made sure to incorporate that tremolo picking part at 7:20 though, that's the part that stands out to me the most"
Samuel Adams,Horrors of myself is good when you don't have a bitch in your ear singing all pitchy!
Degan Nestrichal,haha now i have these forever!
Samuel Adams,This reminds me
Samuel Adams,I should upload the versions of the songs I have now onto SC
Samuel Adams,Just so I can say I left it somewhere and then focus all of my efforts on streaming services!
Degan Nestrichal,"NOO u have to be a capitalist and put everything on paid streaming services! that way when some pleb w/o spotify or apple music asks u to kindly listen to your music, you turn him down, call him poor, and make him buy spotify premium!"
Samuel Adams,Be With U - Vesterlis.mp3.exe
Samuel Adams,There must be 10 versions of ain't so pretty floating around
Degan Nestrichal,"goodbye my little kitten, ill see you on discord!"
Austin Medina,The one we release is gonna be the one where i unleash a face melting guitar solo
Degan Nestrichal,u wish faggot
Austin Medina,Shut up u mexican
Degan Nestrichal,"dont call me a mexican, thats the worst thing u can call someone other than a liberal"
Austin Medina,Mexican liberal face ass
Degan Nestrichal,austin just mad he cant get any latina girl to even look at him!
Samuel Adams,Now I'm going to let this sit here and rust while I tend to more important matters!
Samuel Adams,Austin play sun in the sky + rotting alive at work and see what those normies think of it
Samuel Adams,Are they doing car BDSM over there? :O
Austin Medina,Idk what the fuck they doin
Austin Medina,I think theyre sawing into a safe
Samuel Adams,Eddie why did no one tell me human thing transitioned so well into sun in the sky
Samuel Adams,I should've mixed it to actually do this
Samuel Adams,Why are there so many bots on soundcloud lmao
Austin Medina,Yeah deadass lmao
Austin Medina,Supposedly the epa is gonna start cracking down on modifying cars lol
Austin Medina,Im actually genuinely concerned for the future due to the amount of influence and control the government has in the us and well in general across the globe
Samuel Adams,What are they doing?
Austin Medina,Well theyre planning on making it illegal to manufacture and install any emissions related performance upgrades on vehicles even if theyre being converted strictly for track purposes
Austin Medina,"So obviously this applies to street vehicles too, even if you can pass your emissions they dont care they dont want turbos, intakes, exhaust upgrades none of that"
Austin Medina,Im sure eventually itll extend to suspension and wheels because that affects gas mileage too
Samuel Adams,They take away turbos and suddenly those cheap modern engines are a looot cheaper lmao
Austin Medina,Nah they mean aftermarket performance turbos
Samuel Adams,"Remember Austin all cars will be electric by 2030, assimilate or die"
Austin Medina,Those lil turbos are for gas mileage
Samuel Adams,"All cars will cease to exist by 2050, assimilate or die"
Samuel Adams,In all reality I'm very curious what cars might look like in the 50s
Samuel Adams,"""The EPA stated in an email that it had no interest in cracking down on those who manufacture, sell or install parts that transform street-legal vehicles into race-cars only operated on a track. What is illegal, according to the EPA, is modifying emissions controls in vehicles that will be used on streets and highways."""
Austin Medina,They can say that but there was talk about it coming to fruition plus they tried to crack down on it in the past so theyre interested in cracking down
Austin Medina,Some companies have been run into the ground too after facing legal action brought by the epa after they were being held accountable for shit out of their control like people using their products on street rigs
J Cole Patt,I have joined the arma 3 Creation Community.
Samuel Adams,I have to wonder what legal protections exist for these companies
Samuel Adams,"I mean, if you sell a hookah or bong, you can technically market it as a tobacco product and no one can say it's specifically marketed for weed"
Samuel Adams,"But this doesn't always hold up because juul had to get rid of its more lucrative flavors despite the company saying no, we're not marketing it to minors"
Austin Medina,"Many things complicated, me no like"
Samuel Adams,These companies should countersue if they're a legitimate business selling these mods for race car purposes
Samuel Adams,At that point you're just lumping everyone together
Austin Medina,I just dont think they should be stepping into this sector like come on bruh let people enjoy things
Austin Medina,Next thing you know theyll be barring people from driving without purpose because emissions
Austin Medina,"Like what if i just wanna go for a car ride, one could argue thats as bad as mods because im driving for no reason"
Samuel Adams,"I mean the whole emissions thing is kind of a meme because even if the US magically got rid of all carbon emissions, China, India, and Africa aren't just gonna follow suit"
Samuel Adams,And I guarantee these regions pollute waaaay more than we do
J Cole Patt,This sounds like a discord vc call id like to listen to
Degan Nestrichal,ye so austin can be autistic and play guitar on his 200% volume laptop mic
Austin Medina,Shut up u wish u could play getar
Samuel Adams,This should be the new clip for putting music over
Samuel Adams,Kanye sunday service rockin wit cannibal corpse!?
Degan Nestrichal,0 is the amount of times i wanted to hear you play guitar in discord austin
Austin Medina,Then mute me u stupid dick
Austin Medina,ðº
Samuel Adams,Typical vestralis fans here
Samuel Adams,For fuck's sake Eddie you can't tell me those original mixes were good enough to merit 437 listens
Degan Nestrichal,dude you've got it all wrong I advertised ur band in Madison any chance i got!
Samuel Adams,Lmao
Samuel Adams,I'm chuckling at the thought of Madison kids drunkenly vibing with Two of A Kind
Degan Nestrichal,i think 50% of those listens are rotting alive
Austin Medina,we gotta play some gigs this summer by any means necessary it would be so fuckin fun
Austin Medina,we can make this shit work just gotta put in the time and effort
Samuel Adams,You're preachin to the choir lol
Austin Medina,"i know, it sucks living so far apart but wait hows this work in summer? u gonna be in keno or staying in mke"
Samuel Adams,This is probably the last summer I will stay in kenosha I presume
Samuel Adams,"I mean, in all likelihood I'll move back in with the folks after college but we'll have to see"
Austin Medina,thats probably a good choice unless you land a good job right off the bat
Austin Medina,as bad as i want to move out i admit i am not ready
Degan Nestrichal,im thinking theres no way i listened to SDC 437 times
Degan Nestrichal,i think a few times i might have had the playlist in the background idle
Degan Nestrichal,wuts if vijay did actually listen and started bumping the band
Degan Nestrichal,i could see him having sex to rotting alive
Austin Medina,i think i worked out how i want aint so pretty to go
Samuel Adams,He fucks milfs who only like underground music
Austin Medina,"damn apparently there was a crash on greenbay on 9th by where i turn to go home, happened like 1 min before i got there lol"
Austin Medina,had to take a different way home
Samuel Adams,Damn who took this picture of Raul
Austin Medina,why did i immediately think of raul when i saw it too LMFAO
Austin Medina,"btw the porter got is this like 6'2 blonde guy with super long straight hair, typical skateborder type lmao hes cool"
Elijah Parker,Sounds chill.
Austin Medina,"yeah hes pretty chill, he caught on fast so thats nice"
Samuel Adams,Ask him if he plays an instrument
Austin Medina,i actually will i forgot to ask that
Elijah Parker,then judge him if he says anything besides the big dick Chad ukulele.
Austin Medina,hope he plays bass or drums
Elijah Parker,Trying to get a band mate
Samuel Adams,We need to put a band together by May! It's imperative
Austin Medina,we should put up fliers at music shops bro
Austin Medina,no cap
Samuel Adams,I wouldn't even know how to describe how we sound to other people LOL
Elijah Parker,Sam and I are going to go to music go round sometime soon.
Austin Medina,electric church music
Samuel Adams,"I like alice in chains, smashing pumpkins, kyuss, and all manner of folksy stuff but that doesn't even cover 10% of it"
Austin Medina,we could also just say were looking for people to jam with and hopefully play some shows in the forseeable future
Austin Medina,i know that music center has a board dedicated to fliers and posters for shows and people recruiting
Degan Nestrichal,rock music has already been done idiots! you'll never make it in the industry! ur swimming in the water without knowing whats beneath u!
Austin Medina,i dont wanna make it
Austin Medina,i just wanna rock
Samuel Adams,This is going to be my stepping stone to a successful solo career duh
Samuel Adams,I've already proven I can write music suited to normies
Austin Medina,bruh
Degan Nestrichal,invent a new genre normies
Samuel Adams,"And then, on that glorious day when I have financial security because of the opportunity music has offered me, I will turn on a distortion pedal"
Samuel Adams,To imply we would do anything else with an actual music career is pure NPC behavior!
Samuel Adams,"We can't miss the part that says ""career"""
Degan Nestrichal,walk the talk or lame!
Samuel Adams,In all honesty I don't think I would want to not play music without a band
Samuel Adams,I'd have to be like a folk americana artist or something lmao
Austin Medina,okay i came up with some riffs i like a lot sam
Degan Nestrichal,"Awesome, Austin Medina! Will you come on discord and play each of them over and over for us?"
Austin Medina,ur fucking annoying shut the fuck up god damn
Degan Nestrichal,Triggered snowflake!
Degan Nestrichal,So much for the tolerant left!
Elijah Parker,me whenever the group is active

Samuel Adams,Holy shit
Degan Nestrichal,MPG for it tho is prob cancer
Degan Nestrichal,"decent deal tho, esp. if u use the pickup trucks for its intended purpose"

Degan Nestrichal,i mean im sure he prob needs something portable
Degan Nestrichal,PCs are better just because they have modular design and easy to upgrade
Degan Nestrichal,eli if u want something dirt cheap and running
Degan Nestrichal,here it is
Degan Nestrichal,wait jk that one doesnt have a battery
Degan Nestrichal,"eli be like ""Yo Eddo check this out!!"""
Degan Nestrichal,yeah it appears that the cheapest functional computers on ebay are at least $200
Degan Nestrichal,id recommend a thinkpad tho since they are literally built for business and are economically efficient in that sense
Degan Nestrichal,if ur gonna cheap out that is
Samuel Adams,Eddie how much did your Forenza cost
Degan Nestrichal,3.5k
Samuel Adams,Bet
Degan Nestrichal,y u ask
Samuel Adams,Wanted to see what a competitive price for a car like that was
Samuel Adams,I'm sure half of these listings are lowballing it and they'll try to talk you into a higher price kek
Degan Nestrichal,"it wasnt a very good deal on my part, realistically it should have been cheaper for just being a discontinued manufacturer but i was a desperate 18 yr old"
Degan Nestrichal,like 35k miles tho
Degan Nestrichal,"so i was like eh, it prob wont break down as much"
Degan Nestrichal,also taxes are a thing if ur buying from a dealership
Samuel Adams,I wouldn't fuck with a dealership quite yet
Samuel Adams,I especially don't wanna finance a car
Degan Nestrichal,xd i paid in cash
Samuel Adams,"I'm obviously not gonna get something right now because I'll presumably get the Escape in the next few months but maybe I should be taking that into account, I could probably sell it for like 3k"
Samuel Adams,"It's actually got low mileage for its year, all of the escapes I see on marketplace are routinely above 140k miles"
Samuel Adams,The rear bumper is fucked though so I dunno
Degan Nestrichal,guys lets all pool our money together and quit college/work
Degan Nestrichal,and buy this home

Samuel Adams,What kinda music do they play?
Degan Nestrichal,fk the one time where i have an assignment on communism in literature JJ isnt online!
Degan Nestrichal,erm sam
Degan Nestrichal,is communism the one that calls for teh abolishing of labor
Samuel Adams,No that'd be a utopian ideal
Samuel Adams,"Communism is from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"
Samuel Adams,"You still work, but it's not wage labor, it's what you want to do, what you can contribute to society"
Samuel Adams,"Now a communist utopia is a classless, moneyless society, but that's a different thing altogether"
Degan Nestrichal,"âRobots throughout the world, we command you to kill all mankind. Spare no man. Spare no woman. Save factories, railways, machinery, mines and raw materials. Destroy the rest. Then return to work. Work must not be stopped.'"
Degan Nestrichal,how can i draw technophilia from this?
Samuel Adams,"An emphasis on robots being ""better"" creations and therefore getting rid of humanity"
Samuel Adams,"The technophiliac part of it is just preferring machines to humans, this is just an extreme example"
Degan Nestrichal,"i see, i see"
Degan Nestrichal,hope my TA isnt some gommie that is gonna tear apart everything i say about gommunism and silence me!
Degan Nestrichal,"i remember when i followed with bisexual communist and when of soulsticeisabsent's normie friends commented ""MOTHER RUSSIA""!"
Degan Nestrichal,how cringe!
Samuel Adams,Ew! Little do they realize that Russia is now a fascist oligarchy!
Samuel Adams,I'm still in soul's graveyard
Samuel Adams,What am I doing here

Austin Medina,ah shit what u mean sam
Austin Medina,"oh damn, school got you stretched thin bro"
Samuel Adams,Long story short my padre didn't get the social security case and we were sorta banking on that so the future is uncertain for a few things
Samuel Adams,For one I'm almost certainly not gonna get my 1300 back at least not for a while
Austin Medina,i see
Austin Medina,so wait theyre not getting anything from the case?
Samuel Adams,I believe it can be appealed but that's another waiting process
Samuel Adams,"It's nothing but waiting, really, and it's dogshit but what can ya do"
Austin Medina,that sucks man sorry to hear that
Degan Nestrichal,damn is ur family gonna be alright?
Austin Medina,is your family gonna be okay tho like
Samuel Adams,Yeah we'll be fine but it's probably back to living frugally
Samuel Adams,Unfortunately in my dads case he really can't work so there's not much we can do about it
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna have to raise my own funds to get a car because case money or not I can't just wait around to have one this summer
Samuel Adams,Don't worry about me boys I'll be fine I just gotta see what I can do
Austin Medina,we gotta help sam get a bumpin ride bro
Austin Medina,its our destiny
Degan Nestrichal,"i know u prob dread the idea of warehouse work but itd be a good opportunity, a month and a half of that shit and ull have a car"

Degan Nestrichal,"as long as u pass a piss test, so stay away from weed after april"
Austin Medina,i actually was gonna do that shit until i got hired at the dealership
Samuel Adams,I haven't had weed since that edible so I should be fine
Austin Medina,yeah youll probably pass rn
Degan Nestrichal,they have never drug tested me the 6 months i worked there but they drug tested eli before hire xd
Austin Medina,eli looks like a stoner
Degan Nestrichal,so idk if they are sus they will is probably the protocol
Austin Medina,eddie looks like a hard working mejicano
Samuel Adams,Honestly boys this'll sound weird but I'm just taking this as an omen that I need to get my shit in gear
Austin Medina,doesnt sound weird
Austin Medina,"it just reinforces the fact that there are no givens in life, gotta go what you want"
Samuel Adams,I can't just rest on my laurels and autopilot my way through life anymore I gotta actually focus on what's ahead and not depend on someone else's success
Austin Medina,"exactly, youre the master of your own destiny"
Austin Medina,now u just gotta make a plan and enact it
Samuel Adams,I certainly don't look like a stoner either lmao
Austin Medina,i mean
Austin Medina,kinda
Austin Medina,but anyway just pass the test
Samuel Adams,The long hair is the only thing

Samuel Adams,Still not gonna jeopardize it though lmao that'd just be my luck
Austin Medina,"true lmao, they wont care about your hair tho im sure its not like youre in a customer service role"
Degan Nestrichal,i know multiple ppl there at uline that had it as their first job so u dont gotta worry about it
Austin Medina,just drink water and stretch right eddie lol
Degan Nestrichal,or just not look like a weed smoking cocksuckey
Austin Medina,im talking about being in shape for that kind of work

Samuel Adams,Life makes you die kek
Samuel Adams,Do what makes you happy
J Cole Patt,you are correct
Elijah Parker,We all die bro might as well spend the time we have alive doing what we like.
Elijah Parker,Like going to build a bear with your girlfriend and little sister and making a saber cat dressed like lando and then carrying that mf in your arms the rest of the time you're at the mall :):)

Samuel Adams,Let's do all of the above
Austin Medina,All we need is a drummer
J Cole Patt,I gotta dedicate all my income to heroin so i cant pay rent.
Samuel Adams,What is the point of life if not to enjoy it
J Cole Patt,Heroin and Rockstar goes hand in hand lmao
Austin Medina,Deadass imma come kick it and hopefully jam a lot when possible when you get the apartment sam
J Cole Patt,Chances are you can probably kick it at my place as well with a whole basement to play music.
Austin Medina,Imma start working on music more hopefully as much as i can
J Cole Patt,deadass
J Cole Patt,Samuel give me songs to play
J Cole Patt,"or, to learn rather"
J Cole Patt,as well as bass or guitar with them.
Samuel Adams,Fuk
Samuel Adams,I'd recommend some more alice in chains songs just because I know how to play a good number of them
J Cole Patt,Sweet
Samuel Adams,"Smashing pumpkins, nirvana, led zeppelin, black sabbath"
Samuel Adams,"Try Junkhead and Bullet With Butterfly Wings, those are both in e flat"
J Cole Patt,Sweet
J Cole Patt,Tf is this shit
Degan Nestrichal,straight gas
Samuel Adams,This is also the video with the infamous China Virus Election
Austin Medina,Whats good jiggus
Samuel Adams,Getting my chinavirus vaccine today! Fuck!
Degan Nestrichal,sam gonna be talking about how good windows 10 is
Austin Medina,Man i really wanna suck on bill gates balls now
Degan Nestrichal,youtube-dl is based
Degan Nestrichal,im gonna download so much copyrighted music with this tool!
Degan Nestrichal,heres the link for any of you smooth-brained limp dick faggots who are interested!
Degan Nestrichal,"it has many options for audio formatting and video formatting, downloading entire playlists etc"
Austin Medina,Imma read the art of war
Degan Nestrichal,lol i remember making this meme
Degan Nestrichal,just now when u mentioned it
J Cole Patt,Sam is correct about sleeping on it
J Cole Patt,I was having trouble earlier playing a song and I took a breaj from it
J Cole Patt,I wake up
J Cole Patt,and it b a natural thing now.
Samuel Adams,What song was it?
J Cole Patt,That hysteria song
J Cole Patt,0 0 10 0 10 12 0 7 0 8 7 5 7 5
J Cole Patt,I can play that now
J Cole Patt,Before i struggled with the 10 12 0 7 part
J Cole Patt,Now i can do that
Samuel Adams,Fuk yeah
J Cole Patt,I shall plug away at it
Samuel Adams,If you can learn that on bass you're already off to a fantastic start
Samuel Adams,It's a difficult bassline to play but even harder to maintain
J Cole Patt,P much just practice.
Samuel Adams,Do you play along to backing tracks?
J Cole Patt,But im glad that nothing is really getting in my way.
J Cole Patt,I kinda do
J Cole Patt,That website i use
J Cole Patt,Songster
J Cole Patt,It plays all the stuff in the back.
Samuel Adams,If you look up a track of hysteria without bass on youtube you can try to play along to the studio track
J Cole Patt,Helos me stay on track as well.
J Cole Patt,I think i should get the hang of knowing the whole thing first
Samuel Adams,That's a good habit to have
Samuel Adams,I can't say it's one I picked up when I started playing myself lmao
Samuel Adams,All I did was learn how to play particular riffs and then quickly hit a wall because I didn't know how to play the whole song
Samuel Adams,Investing is just gambling with extra steps
Samuel Adams,Got my vaccine boys
J Cole Patt,Hows it feel
J Cole Patt,"I gotta say waking up, youll feel like shit."
Samuel Adams,Maybe a little immediate soreness but nothing else
J Cole Patt,At lwast thats me.
J Cole Patt,Are you telling me
J Cole Patt,That i dont need to play it that way
J Cole Patt,I can just
J Cole Patt,play the C Chord differently.
Samuel Adams,For the chorus yes
J Cole Patt,I am now angry
Samuel Adams,The chorus of hysteria is literally just a power chord where you slide up from the 2nd fret
Samuel Adams,If you listen to the isolated guitar track you'll hear what I mean
J Cole Patt,Weird af tbh
Degan Nestrichal,sam gonna wake up and preach to us about how FOSS is a gateway to communism
Samuel Adams,I don't like Richard stillman anymore! Strange but this feeling just washed over me!
Degan Nestrichal,holy fuck im gonna farm so many upcumies with this custom music client
Degan Nestrichal,ive only downloaded three albums
Degan Nestrichal,@Samuel Adams so i made a big mistake..
Degan Nestrichal,accidently deleted SDC once my way!
Austin Medina,whatd you o
Austin Medina,"honestly i might sell this civic lmao, shit burns so much oil"
Austin Medina,gonna try a few easy fixes first to slow it down but ill see
Samuel Adams,I'll buy it from you Austin I'm an expert with sticks â¤ï¸
Austin Medina,2k ill give it to you rn
Austin Medina,no cap
Austin Medina,with the swag wheels on it
Samuel Adams,Maybe ask me in a few weeks I might have 2k on hand
Austin Medina,if ur serious just know youre taking a risk with maybe fucking the clutch as you learn to drive stick
Austin Medina,or better yet learn to drive stick on the focus first then buy it
Degan Nestrichal,this dumbass is in over his head thinking he can learn stick!
Degan Nestrichal,plus driving stick is gay ur literally revolving a cock around the entire time while u drive where as with an auto u only do it like twice in a drive
Austin Medina,@Samuel Adams buy this
Degan Nestrichal,where do u think sam is gonna come up with this drug money
Austin Medina,ill give him a 1800 dollar loan with just 30 percent interest
Samuel Adams,You can make big loud noises with a manual
Austin Medina,yes
Samuel Adams,And I'll have an excuse not to check my phone to see Eli's latest dick pic while in traffic!
Austin Medina,red line your car as soon as you start it to clean the carbon off your fuel injectors
Austin Medina,maybe ill just buy an acura tl
Degan Nestrichal,feel like learning on manny would be pretty weird
Austin Medina,"its actually really good imo, i wish i had learned because it kind of forces you to learn about how your engine puts power to the wheels via the transmission and it makes you pay more attention"
Degan Nestrichal,i suppose thats useful if u wanna learn cars
Austin Medina,"i mean its very basic knowledge even, its pretty practical to understand a bit about cars so you dont get ripped off at dealerships or mechanics"
J Cole Patt,I think learning about cars might be fuckey for us due to electrical cars being a bit more
J Cole Patt,Available.
J Cole Patt,Unless they are the same in a way idk
Austin Medina,"all this talk about electric cars is kind of blown out of proportion, the majority of cars on the road and being produced nowadays are ICE and will be on the road for most likely decades, theyre not just gonna disappear unless the government mandates that ice cars not be allowed anymore at which point we have bigger issues"
Samuel Adams,Throttle blipping finally made sense to me the other day and I'm not sure why it took me so long to figure it out
Austin Medina,but hopefully porsche comes in clutch and developes synthetic fuel
Austin Medina,yeah it takes a bit of time to rap your head around all the techniques in manual
Samuel Adams,"I was like ""hurr why would you rev up to go down"" but then I remember as soon as you let off the clutch the engine's gotta match the power the wheels are sending it kek"
Samuel Adams,Your synchros have to work harder if you don't do it and then your car will jerk like a dumbass!
Austin Medina,"yes, gotta try to match the transmission speed with the engine speed"
Degan Nestrichal,diesel cars gonna die off soon anyways
Degan Nestrichal,no point in learning!
Samuel Adams,There's a big market for diesels still
Austin Medina,yeah huge market lol
Samuel Adams,Towing capacity in particular
Austin Medina,diesel trucks are the best in the world
Austin Medina,"much better than gas, they can last 1 million miles if you wanted to make it last that long"
Austin Medina,granted you would probably go through a few transmissions over that 1 million
Samuel Adams,Honestly the body itself would probably go before the engine did
Austin Medina,"if youre around here yeah, but say in arizona"
Austin Medina,"its possible, in fact its been done lmao"
Degan Nestrichal,this might be useful if ur in the automotive industry but otherwise its only useful in special circumstances
Austin Medina,i think it was a gas motor that went a million miles in a silverado actually funnily enoguh
Austin Medina,transmission replacement is a lot cheaper than a new modern truck
Austin Medina,full size trucks are like at least 45-50k nowadays
Degan Nestrichal,like outside of buying/maintaining a car wut else is there austino for the average limp dick haver like me
Samuel Adams,Cars don't necessarily have to be useful Eddie
Samuel Adams,They can just be fun
Austin Medina,wym what else is there
Degan Nestrichal,quite expensive of a hobby to say the least lol
Degan Nestrichal,cars are more of a liability to me personally
Austin Medina,yeah it is expensive
Austin Medina,"yeah its not for every body, it is a liability for sure"
Samuel Adams,I think I'll have more interest in it once I'm actually licensed and have a good bit of time behind the wheel but yeah
Austin Medina,we should go to car meets
Austin Medina,just get ur license it will make your life so much more fun and interesting having that ability
Degan Nestrichal,sam is the original SITSRA gone forever? ð
Samuel Adams,No it's still there
Samuel Adams,All of the original SDC tracks are private on soundcloud
Samuel Adams,Except Two of A Kind which has been deleted forever
Degan Nestrichal,i clicked on the original link and it brought me to the newest SITSRA
Samuel Adams,But yeah lads my dad's SS case is up in the air but I have been deemed eligible for chapter 35 benefits
Samuel Adams,And they've marked it back all the way to march 2020
Samuel Adams,"If it plays out the way I think it will, I might get a check for 12k"
Austin Medina,God damn bro
Samuel Adams,I just gotta go to financial aid and get the paperwork processed
Samuel Adams,"And then it's 1224 a month for 36 months, which I assume is 36 months from the starting date so it'd be 1 year paid in advance and 2 years of monthly stipends"
Austin Medina,this nigga dont even gotta work!
Samuel Adams,On the contrary I certainly want to get a job at uline over the summer
Samuel Adams,This just means I get to drive eddie to work and not the other way around LMAO!
Austin Medina,do you still drive the forenza eddie
Degan Nestrichal,wut kind of a question is dat
Samuel Adams,Eddie doesn't go through cars like you do Austin! He's a normie consoomer ;(
Austin Medina,doesnt seem like you drive it very much
Degan Nestrichal,"well ye usually just go the grocery store, laundry, then when we hangout"
Samuel Adams,Eddie's gotta get himself a girlfriend so he can have stinky dirty sex in the backseat
Austin Medina,"i got u man, i kind of wish my commute wasnt so long but tbh it isnt that bad because usually the roads i drive on arent busy"
Degan Nestrichal,"and i am not a normie consoomer! i am too redpilled to be invested in cars as i recognize that they are an artificial crutch placed by our government, you limp dick bootlicker!"
Samuel Adams,"You're right, if only our country wasn't bought and paid for by Big Oil and then we could have an efficient railway system in this country :("
Austin Medina,i still think i would be into cars if i lived in an area with really good public transport
Samuel Adams,The only hobbies worth having are those that cost an arm and a leg to maintain!
Degan Nestrichal,how bought u go write ur own compiler dumbass?
Degan Nestrichal,"sam u should look into the youtube-dl git repo i sent, its busted"
Degan Nestrichal,"u can just download an entire playlist in mp3, wav, m4a or w/e"
Samuel Adams,I'll look at it
Samuel Adams,It'll be very useful to me because I like to dl backing tracks off of youtube and record guitar parts over them
Austin Medina,Yeah sam is a fucking nigger for not making his own compiler
Degan Nestrichal,Sam the type of dude to use gcc to write his kernel ð Swimming in the water without knowing what's beneath you looking ass mf ð¤£ð¤£ð¤£
Samuel Adams,Austin can't even heel toe shift! What a fucking idiot LOL!
Austin Medina,i was thinking about learning but idk i dont really need to use it
J Cole Patt,What are ice cars?
J Cole Patt,ICE
Samuel Adams,Internal combustion engine
Samuel Adams,The normal kind of car that burns gas in order to get going
Austin Medina,sam whats the point of heel toeing
Samuel Adams,It's essentially breaking while rev matching
Samuel Adams,Better way to downshift I suppose
Austin Medina,oh so you brake while blipping the throttle
Austin Medina,idk seems kind of unnecessary but i guess maybe if youre on a race track
Samuel Adams,"Yeah, your toe's on the brake pedal and your heel catches the throttle"
J Cole Patt,Sounds weird
Austin Medina,im hoping some of the stuff im gonna do to my honda helps prevent leaks and burnign
J Cole Patt,Synthetic Fuel sounds p rad
J Cole Patt,Legit i hope people can see why science is a gucci tjing but we migjt mot even have livestock one day.
J Cole Patt,All those vegan burgers and such.
Austin Medina,pcv could be causing extra fuel vapors to remain in the crank case and causing extra pressure to build up and increase the leaking in the crank case areas
J Cole Patt,Oof
J Cole Patt,Vegan Meat
Austin Medina,and then valve cover gasket will prevent oil leaks from the top of the engine and hopefully prevent oil leaks from spark plug tubes
Austin Medina,and then also thiccer oil
Samuel Adams,This is gonna be Austin when he's teaching me how to drive manual
Austin Medina,kek its not that hard when you get it going
J Cole Patt,MEDIUM LEFT
J Cole Patt,LIGHT RIGHT
J Cole Patt,OBTUSE LEFT
J Cole Patt,I want a driver instructor thats like victor reznov
J Cole Patt,YOU NEED TO TAKE LEFT TURN
J Cole Patt,RIGHT MY FRIEND
Austin Medina,Sam was one of them
Samuel Adams,"It's true, I voted for a guy who can't walk up a flight of stairs without falling"
Austin Medina,Shits scary how is he gonna make it to 2024 in good enough condition to be pres

Austin Medina,"Possibly, gonna have to get together to jam it out"
Samuel Adams,Guys I went under J's alias and got my vaccination poggers
Samuel Adams,Austin Eddie if you boys wanna get vaccinated at the wisconsin center they weren't checking my school ID or even confirmed if I lived at Mashuda lmao
Austin Medina,Are you serious lol
Austin Medina,This covid distribution shit is so fucked LMAO
Samuel Adams,All they took a look at was my state ID which presumably was just to confirm that I made an appointment
Austin Medina,How do you make an apoint ment
Samuel Adams,I repeatedly asked if they wanted to see my school ID and no one wanted to see it
Austin Medina,Lmao wtf
Austin Medina,Theyre like yeah this guy smells like open septic tank hes a local
Samuel Adams,Honestly most of the people I saw today seemed like they were in a hurry
Samuel Adams,Put out that I was trying to talk to them almost lmao
Austin Medina,Cash money
Samuel Adams,Pog
Samuel Adams,"The way Dorothy falls off the fence when he sings ""balanced on the biggest wave"" is fucking spooky"
Samuel Adams,I think J's right and they're just trying to vaccinate as many people as possible
J Cole Patt,Ye
J Cole Patt,Whoever is willing to get it.
J Cole Patt,Herd immunity helps.
Samuel Adams,Wait J I just realized we got a vaccine from the exact same lot number lmao
Samuel Adams,I don't know if that's notable or not
Degan Nestrichal,do u guys have to go back for a second dose or something
Samuel Adams,Yeah I'm scheduled to go back on the 16th of april
Degan Nestrichal,this geo TA faggot gave me 50% when i turned in my assignment less than a minute late
Austin Medina,So samwell
Degan Nestrichal,ima prob wait
Degan Nestrichal,i am low risk
Samuel Adams,What's up
Austin Medina,"Heres some interesting bit of tech and engineering for cars, i was reading up on pcv which means positive crankcase ventilation, so when the combustion occurs in the cylinder, small amounts of unburnt fuel fumes can blow past the piston rings and make they way into the crank case and increase the pressure in said crank case, which is where the crankshaft is located"
Degan Nestrichal,OMG THIS IS NERD STUFF!!
Degan Nestrichal,I GOTTA GET AWAY
Austin Medina,So im thinking maybe my pcv valve is clogged or partially clogged and causing too much pressure to build up in the crank case and worsening the effects of oil leaking because naturally increased pressure on a liquid is gonna make attempt to exit whatever container its in if there is a way out
Samuel Adams,Is this a beneficial effect for combustion or the engine
Samuel Adams,"I was gonna say, doesn't sound like fun lmao"
Austin Medina,"No its kind of just a side effect, a working pcv system does route the fumes back to the cylinders where they can be combusted however so it prevents polution"
Samuel Adams,How does the engine get gas in the civic
Samuel Adams,Is it direct injection?
Austin Medina,"Idek tbh i think so, id have to look it up"
Austin Medina,"I noticed the bottom was all greasy so im thinking probably rear main seal is leaking but im really not up for that job, gotta bring out the transmission literally"
Samuel Adams,Just put her into reverse going 80 and you can get the transmission out easy!
Austin Medina,Lmao
Austin Medina,I mean tbh it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world to engine swap it if i had a garage
Austin Medina,"Because theres no pressure, i can work at my pace and just drive the jeep because its actually in really solid shape after the radiator"
J Cole Patt,Get vacced
J Cole Patt,Honestly the only reason to get vacced is so u can come over to my grandparents
J Cole Patt,Which is well worth it
Samuel Adams,This is true
Austin Medina,Are ur grand parents vaccinated
J Cole Patt,they are
J Cole Patt,Almost
J Cole Patt,they gotta get their 2md shot.
Austin Medina,Why i gotta get vaccinated if theyre fully vaccinated
Austin Medina,Is it just a stipulation they put in place
Samuel Adams,I'm going to assume that's the case
J Cole Patt,P much as a way to motivate people to come over
Samuel Adams,They're probably concerned about their house being a spreader event even if they can't get sick lmao
J Cole Patt,But also in case the chamce they come over
J Cole Patt,Ye that
Samuel Adams,"Yo grandma did you know after that banging concert where Sam and Austin played Ain't So Pretty for 3 hours, 8 people got covid? Lmao!"
Austin Medina,Its our only song okay!
Austin Medina,"We should write a ""my woman left me"" style blues song"
J Cole Patt,How sad do you want it
Samuel Adams,I've definitely written at least one of these
Samuel Adams,There is a song bank full of around 100 lyrics which is fucking insane to me
Samuel Adams,I keep myself busy
Austin Medina,"Not necessarily sad more like kind of sassy and swag, like red house with the snarky if my baby dont love me no more, i know her sister will"
Samuel Adams,It's not a blues song but I do have Juxtapose Me which is basically leading on some toxic chick to get into a toxic relationship
Austin Medina,Munchkins getting lit to money
Samuel Adams,Epic
Austin Medina,That shits kinda creepy lol
Austin Medina,What does a>c#something mean
Samuel Adams,I basically slide up the B7 shape two frets
Austin Medina,"Nice chord progression i think it could be refined a bit more, some of it sounds kind of forced"
Austin Medina,Also
Austin Medina,Imagine seeing this 15 years later and realizing you were a fucking mistake
Samuel Adams,I think the vocal melody ties it together
Samuel Adams,Lmao
Austin Medina,"Mayhaps, i havent heard it so that is likely"
Austin Medina,The beginning almost sounds like she fuckin hates me by puddle of mud
Austin Medina,"It does sound better with lyrics cant lie,"
Austin Medina,Kind of gave me an idea i might transpose my idea tho
Samuel Adams,We could transpose the song too
Samuel Adams,Capos are fun things
Samuel Adams,I guess technically you'd call this chord a C#7maj7 but I don't know if that's what I'd call it
Austin Medina,Essentially its modal mixture right
Austin Medina,Thats a pretty common usage too
Samuel Adams,Holy shit! I found Nitsua covering jamiroquai on youtube!
Austin Medina,Nitsua chan
Samuel Adams,I really wanna get into more bass I think
Samuel Adams,This bassline fucks
Austin Medina,This has some grunge vibes
Austin Medina,Theres something charming about the movement from 4 to 1
Samuel Adams,Fisker keeps going down but fuk it I'm gonna buy another share
Samuel Adams,This company will grow in the long run I'm sure of it
J Cole Patt,Me @Eddie
Degan Nestrichal,my stupid audio system wont let me exceed 153% volume!

Austin Medina,You dont sell stocks theyre like pets you keep them forever right
Samuel Adams,Not sure if I can get a backpay for this program I just talked to the lads at financial aid
Samuel Adams,Probably gotta call the guys at the VA and figure it out
Samuel Adams,Because if I get it only after they file the paperwork then I'll be eligible up until March 2024 which would be useless to me because I probably won't be getting a master's lmao
Degan Nestrichal,this guy is apparently 21.. right..
Degan Nestrichal,"another day another mass shooting, murica ðºð¸"
Austin Medina,We're gonna launch into the gun control debate again
Austin Medina,Rip
Samuel Adams,You'll never be able to get rid of guns in this country
Samuel Adams,Absolutely never
Samuel Adams,"Prohibition is a good example, alcohol was illegal for a short time and they're still finding bootleg booze in the walls of old homes"
Austin Medina,Goburment can do whatever they want idc
Degan Nestrichal,omg guys we should like ban guns!
Degan Nestrichal,woah epic based red pilled liberal!!
Samuel Adams,"Thanks for your perspective, liberal! Too bad it's the wrong take!"
Degan Nestrichal,$10 the shooter was some incel traditionalist
Austin Medina,Hes a muslim wym lol
Degan Nestrichal,and..?
Austin Medina,Thats what they do
Austin Medina,Theyre traditional
Degan Nestrichal,how tf do they already know this guys life story

Degan Nestrichal,omg im into serial killers ð
Austin Medina,Sloppy joe biden gonna mandate any weapon with a mag over 10 rounds be removed from non government or law enforcement hands
Degan Nestrichal,yes now cops have a 15% higher chance of winning a gunfight vs a civilian
Austin Medina,Non criminal civilians**
Austin Medina,Important distinction
Austin Medina,Eddie you should buy a gun bro
Degan Nestrichal,prob in teh future but for rn nah
Samuel Adams,Are we gonna become gun guys too Austin
Austin Medina,Im gonna get a glock when i turn 21
Degan Nestrichal,im in a zoom breakout room with 7 ppl and none of us have said a word
Degan Nestrichal,i love zoom learning
Austin Medina,"Well i wanna be able to defend my household and family at least, idk if ill become like a collector like with cars"
Austin Medina,Whats a breakout room
Samuel Adams,Your teacher designates you and some losers into a separate call
Degan Nestrichal,"just like virtual discussion groups, partitioned from the original meeting"
Austin Medina,Thats fuckin gay lmao
Samuel Adams,Man Marquette better not fuck me I'm entitled to thousands of dollars! I could buy this fucking school and that's what they're afraid of!
Degan Nestrichal,they're like woah slow down buddy you belong to us now
Samuel Adams,It just makes no sense that Marquette wouldn't be able to pay me when the money is coming from the VA
Degan Nestrichal,"i fucking hate this shit, this isnt even school"
Degan Nestrichal,if this is going on at a top uni like madison i could only imagine how fucking dry some other UW schools are doing
Degan Nestrichal,especially some shithole copout like marquette university! What a disgusting facility it must be over there!
Samuel Adams,It's not too bad honestly but it could be my major too
Samuel Adams,You think CS students are gonna talk to each other? LMAO!
Degan Nestrichal,"i swear im way ahead of the curve on programming but when it comes to some stupid ass esoteric CS course like discrete math, some other math nerd who is more diligent will always best me!"
Samuel Adams,Bureaucracies are gay!

Austin Medina,"It has heated steering and seats, dark brown leather with wood inlays"
Degan Nestrichal,austin just get a modular car
Austin Medina,Tf u say to me nigfa
Degan Nestrichal,austin too retarted to know what the word modular means
Austin Medina,Eddie too nerd to understand how badass a cammed Camaro sounds
Degan Nestrichal,apple does not make very modular products
Degan Nestrichal,building your own computer is an example of a modular design
Degan Nestrichal,"because of replaceability of other parts on the whole system, future-proof design, no predatory ecosystem, etc."
Austin Medina,Most i know about modular is modular synthesis for music
Austin Medina,Where u have huge walls of synths that you can swap out and exchange for others and such
Degan Nestrichal,"yeah modular just means replaceablility in a sense, but it doesnt make sense to just say it that way"
Degan Nestrichal,examples of it are more illustrative
Austin Medina,"Fasho, have you heard of kit cars? Like basically it comes with some portions of a car but you swap like a miata engine and drive train into it and theyre super fast and fun to drive"
Austin Medina,"They come as a kit tho all you need is tools, even comes with step by step directions"
Degan Nestrichal,"ye i have heard of them i think, i wonder wut the price tag would be for those tho"
Austin Medina,"I'm not too sure I'm guessing somewhere probably around $10,000"
Austin Medina,"Further proof that gm is dog shit, 16 miles and has a check engine light and reduced engine power warning"
Degan Nestrichal,ew non-japanese car
Austin Medina,Ikr
Samuel Adams,Gm and Stellantis owned cars are horrible products
Samuel Adams,It's a good thing Honda and Toyota are still competing for best car brand
Samuel Adams,It means the accord and the camry will at least be good for another 10 years until all the normies hop on the EV train
Austin Medina,Sam just buy as much accord as you can afford sam
Austin Medina,"Like tbh accord and camry cant really be beat as a first car lmao, they run forever"
Degan Nestrichal,this why u dont get kids they fk up ur car and shit everywhere
Austin Medina,I dont think ill care more about a car than my own children in this theoretical world but we'll see
Degan Nestrichal,theoretical world where austin is a sex haver!
Austin Medina,Where austin is a sinner**
Degan Nestrichal,having sex for pleasure is only for neanderthals like Sam xD
Austin Medina,Ikr what a fgt

Samuel Adams,The hardest part is undoubtedly playing it over and over and in time with the song
Austin Medina,Lmao i would love to play drums but alas no space in my room
J Cole Patt,Just gotta rememver it first.
Austin Medina,What did you think of that riff i sent last night that was kind of a variation of yours. I kinda stripped the tonality out of it and made it all power chords
Samuel Adams,"I liked it, it had a Nirvana/grungy vibe to it as you said"
Austin Medina,Yeah i concur its that 4 to 1 movement imo that gives it  that feeling
Austin Medina,This is my first time driving the Honda in the rain I'm surprised it is doing so well
J Cole Patt,U gucci?
Austin Medina,Yessireee
Austin Medina,Some dumb bitch in a ford escape keeps holding me up but besides that im chilling

Austin Medina,Tbh the only 3000gt to get if you wanna be like legit is the vr-4 which is becoming harder and harder to find
Austin Medina,Otherwise its kind of overweight in the power to weight ratio
Austin Medina,"Vr-4 comes twin turbo, if you want something that looks unique and sporty tho any 3000gt is cool as hell"
Degan Nestrichal,"sam in a month gonna be like fk bro just lost my entire welfare backup to a supposed nigerian prince who was gonna give me $30,000 for $12,000 in google play cards!"

Austin Medina,"that prelude is kind of quick for what it is, 200 hp stock in a 1999 honda is decent"
Austin Medina,"i would probably keep it stock and just try to preserve it, body is really clean"

Austin Medina,eddie shecklesteinberg
Degan Nestrichal,then after our night shift is completed and we have 3 hours before our day shift we will be driving uber for drunk college kids
Samuel Adams,We don't need sleep we have caffeine
Austin Medina,this summers gonna be fun lol
Degan Nestrichal,"fuck i feel so guilty for only working 168 hrs a week, i need to materialize more time in order to get more money"
Samuel Adams,How dare you not go into a pocket dimension and work more hours? What the fuck is wrong with you?!
Samuel Adams,How do you expect to afford the Vestralis concert at Hangar 18?
Degan Nestrichal,mfs be like broke nigga don't go into a pocket dimension and work 250 hrs a week doe
Austin Medina,"man shit, i might quit my job for uline deadass lmao"
Austin Medina,this shits ridiculous the new guy they hired just sits there whenever theres no customers like bro have some hustle and inspiration
Degan Nestrichal,"more pay, less taxes, maybe even a shorter commute"
Degan Nestrichal,austin just wingman him and pretend he's like a shy guy trying to ask out a pretty girl at a high school dance
Austin Medina,nah bro
Degan Nestrichal,lol ive seen that at wendys mfs working at the front register be hiding
Samuel Adams,What could dude be doing in the meantime
Austin Medina,literally anything else
Austin Medina,"go check the water cooler, check the coffee, take out garbage, clean some cars"
Austin Medina,just sitting there looks even worse than standing
Degan Nestrichal,"he is probably borrowing his brain as computational power fouter to the crypto mining gods, dont judge him austin"
Degan Nestrichal,he is literally finding the next ethereum coin in the blockchain as you are just working like a normie!
Austin Medina,the owner of the dealership saw him sitting around today i wonder if hes gonna say anything to my boss
Degan Nestrichal,o shit i thought u said when there was customers
Degan Nestrichal,ehhhhh i mean unless my manager tells me to do something im not gonna do something
Degan Nestrichal,ill still stand tho
Austin Medina,"well that too, if hes sitting there and customers walk in he stays sitting"
Austin Medina,like bruh get up and ask how you can help at least
Degan Nestrichal,"been a while since ive been micromanaged like that tho, at uline ppl just let u do ur own thing"
Austin Medina,i dont even get micromanaged thats the thing i just like to stay busy so no one can say shit to me
Austin Medina,"thats kinda why i wanna be a lube tech, ill be doing something thats a lot more valuable to the effort"
Austin Medina,i should go to school for business administration and be a service director
Austin Medina,that seems like an actually feasible career path for me
Degan Nestrichal,need a bachelors for an MBA
Degan Nestrichal,business isnt really my thing
Samuel Adams,"That's what I'm gonna do after I graduate, lord over Austin"
Austin Medina,yeah i mean it would be a cushy job but
Austin Medina,its not really automotive at all you basically just manage people
Austin Medina,maybe shop foreman but you really gotta know your shit for that
Samuel Adams,"I wouldn't be at all opposed to working on the business side of the automotive industry I think, seems like a good time"
Samuel Adams,Time to learn japanese to communicate with the CEO of toyota
Degan Nestrichal,being a manager is very stressful tho
Austin Medina,bro come be a service director ð¤£
Degan Nestrichal,"like seeing what the managers of a fast-food chain like wendys had to do i felt bad for them, they prob only get paid like 15-20 an hr too"
Austin Medina,"at least from what i can discern from my director, you can spend half your time on facebook and instagram in your office and have everyone tell customers youre not there when they come to complain!! :DD"
Austin Medina,"at least service directors get paid well, i think some can make upwards of 150k a year for a big dealership"
Degan Nestrichal,"yeah but its not like your your own boss, ur still an employee with just higher pay and more responsibilities/liabilities"
Samuel Adams,Let's start our own business then yeah
Samuel Adams,We can be scummy used car salesmen
Austin Medina,or not be scummy lol
Austin Medina,"ive met some really cool people in automotive so far, not everyone is scummy"
Austin Medina,"especially the mechanics, they usually just wanna do their shit and get on with the day, the salesmen are the ones who have to be crafty"
Degan Nestrichal,cmon guys we all know the only cool jobs are being a doctor/lawyer/engineer
Austin Medina,no no you gotta be a teacher/government official/media or else you cant get the covvy vax!!

Austin Medina,"I never see corvette owners driving their cars hard i wonder why, they are sports cars after all"
Samuel Adams,"Aw fug bro just got done reading about how time dilation is the difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks. It is either due to a relative velocity between them (""kinetic"" time dilation, from special relativity) or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (gravitational time dilation, from general relativity). When unspecified, ""time dilation"" usually refers to the effect due to velocity."
Austin Medina,Ah shit ur right wow
Austin Medina,"Anyway, back to vtec"
Degan Nestrichal,fug bro just got done watching a lecture about how memory allocation leaks can cause security issues within your program through a buffer overflow attack

Austin Medina,God damn this bitch nice
Austin Medina,Sam make ur parents buy a 2021 yukon denali
Samuel Adams,I will never own a GM as long as I live
Austin Medina,"Gm cars arent so bad tbh, most modern vehicles cant talk much shit cuz they have their own problems"
Austin Medina,At least the yukon denali and cadillac escalade are luxurious
Samuel Adams,"Before you listen to this man, know that he is a paid Buick and GMC shill!"
Austin Medina,"Im just saying, i will slander gm but they still make some decent cars"
Austin Medina,O shit apparently its come out that the grocery store shooter was a syrin refugee
Austin Medina,Syrian* wonder if he did it because of the us bombing syria
Austin Medina,"Shits weird, probably not cuz hes been in the usa for so long you would imagine he wouldnt care"
Samuel Adams,Heil Biden

Austin Medina,"Sam, 2012 5.0 mustang wit a 6 speed manual trans, 108k miles, guess how much my job is selling it for"
Samuel Adams,14k
Austin Medina,Damn near 20k lmao
Samuel Adams,Is that worth I have no idea
Austin Medina,Which according to my research isnt actually that high but you can get a better deal if you look
Austin Medina,The 5.0 mustangs fetch a lot more than the 4.6 mustangs because the 5.0 makes more power and shit
Austin Medina,Kek
Degan Nestrichal,wtf lol this sounds like some made up story on an incel forum
Samuel Adams,I'm sorry for being make
Samuel Adams,I saw this fuckin guy dropping the clutch in a jetta earlier today lmao
Samuel Adams,German ricer German ricer

Austin Medina,Understandable
Austin Medina,Honda took a shit SMFH
Austin Medina,Might have to sell it for a big loss lmao
Degan Nestrichal,que paso
Austin Medina,Drove to autozone and it stalled in the parking lot even tho it was in neutral and it turns over and starts but it runs like shit
J Cole Patt,ooof
Austin Medina,"Gonna run some tests and shit, try to see if i can narrow it down"
Degan Nestrichal,2004 suzuki forenza: 1
Degan Nestrichal,shitbox japanese car: 0!
Austin Medina,Idek what happened im thinking its not worth fixing
Austin Medina,Iike id have to tear apart the engine or maybe even replace the engine
Samuel Adams,Lmao this is what it would sound like if Matt Bellamy covered Alice In Chains!
Samuel Adams,Why was my first inclination that Austin had Honda stock and it fell badly
Austin Medina,Lmaoooo
Samuel Adams,Austin give me one good reason why I shouldn't buy a ford ranger
Austin Medina,I cant you should definitely get a ffr
Degan Nestrichal,because you'd go in debt dumbass LOL!
Samuel Adams,Money isn't real anyway
Austin Medina,He can get a ffr for 1k
Austin Medina,Imma need a new car i think
Austin Medina,Samson you want el jeepo for 2 grand?
Austin Medina,If i can get 400 for the wheels for 500 for a civic that dont run i would be sitting pretty
Austin Medina,Im looking at more like 300 for the civic but oh well lol
Samuel Adams,Dude somebody's gonna buy that civic off of you and turn it into a 900 hp turbo beast
Austin Medina,"Good for them, theyre probably gonna have to swap the engine because i think that ones fuck ed"
Samuel Adams,Fuckin hell
Austin Medina,Oh well
Samuel Adams,Time for me to learn stick behind the wheel of the dead civic
Austin Medina,Im wondering what it is tho i might rent a compression tester to see if thats the issue
Austin Medina,"If i lost compression its game over, if timing belt snapped i might be okay"
Samuel Adams,Actually that's a little overpriced for a short bed and club cab I feel
Samuel Adams,I don't want a truck I'm silly I won't use it for anything practical
Samuel Adams,What am I doing I need to buy a camry lmao
Austin Medina,I think imma buy a camry next lmao
Austin Medina,No cap theyre too reliable not to
Samuel Adams,My dad is trying to talk me into buying a car through this family friend who works with a ford dealership in indiana
Samuel Adams,"Muh ""They do a 151 point inspection on every car on the lot"""
Austin Medina,Lmao depends what kind of cars they have on the lot for used cars
Samuel Adams,I'm really not tryna get a fusion or focus or anything like that lmao
Samuel Adams,The ford gene did not exactly pass onto me aside from my fetish for ffrs
Austin Medina,And ford must hangs
Elijah Parker,Sam
Elijah Parker,Join discord call bb
Elijah Parker,pls
Samuel Adams,I got hw to do bb
Austin Medina,But franchised dealerships have a lot of used cars too from trade ins and cars they buy at auction
Elijah Parker,You can talk and hw bb
Elijah Parker,Pretty please mate
Samuel Adams,"I asked my dad about that and he basically said ""That was a freak accident and it could have happened to any car"" regarding the busted crankshaft in the freestyle we used to have"
Samuel Adams,Give me approximately 30 minutes I MIGHT come around
Austin Medina,Guess whats happening here
Degan Nestrichal,sam if u wanna get ur license fast dont get a stick
Austin Medina,Dont listen to him sam!!
Austin Medina,"Yeah get an automatic tho, much easier"
Samuel Adams,Lmao even my dad recommended that I wasn't actually gonna buy a manual for my first car
Samuel Adams,But that would be big dick if I got my license with it and triumphed
Samuel Adams,I could probably literally go take the test tomorrow and pass maybe I should
JJ Joseph,Sam you can learn manuel after you pass
Degan Nestrichal,gotta schedule in advance
Degan Nestrichal,cuz it is backed up like a month or 2
Samuel Adams,Gay
JJ Joseph,And you how many hours have you driven overall in a stick
Samuel Adams,Well shit maybe I should schedule now then lmao
JJ Joseph,Because if you want to take the test in one you at least have to know how it works
Samuel Adams,The clutch is just another gas pedal! Everyone knows that!
Degan Nestrichal,how much driving have u done since last time?
Degan Nestrichal,in da fowenza
Samuel Adams,Tbh I can't remember but the forenza was not the last time I drove a car
Austin Medina,"This nigga trippin lol, sam next time we hang out ill let you drive some places"
Samuel Adams,I might actually be driving the focus tomorrow or saturday because I hate all you motherfucking doubters!
Austin Medina,Lemme teach you stick bb
Degan Nestrichal,"if the forenza is the last time u drove or close, then im not really convinced, but hey u got time to transform into a car guy like austin"
Samuel Adams,To be fair it is quite hard to find time in my schedule to drive with no car and no gullible mf who will let me drive theirs at marquette lol
Degan Nestrichal,"just gotta get used to the mechanics and manuevering with a car, thats the biggest hurdle"
JJ Joseph,Just take the test with your parents car learn where everything is then you can learn stick
Samuel Adams,Now I really want to take the test with a manual and pass just to flex on you no-manual-driving mfs
Samuel Adams,Me and Austin will be an elite class of our own
Degan Nestrichal,id say it took me like 2-3 months of driving on and off to be confident
Degan Nestrichal,its diff when ur behind the wheel
Degan Nestrichal,then in theory
Samuel Adams,It's fuckin weird to think I'm at that point in my life where I am running out of blocks of time that large
Samuel Adams,If I don't get my license this summer it's because I've almost certainly died or have been deemed legally unable to do so
Degan Nestrichal,lol sam ill put u behind the wheel to drive to uline
Samuel Adams,When they do the vision test for driving do they test you with your corrected vision or nah lmao because otherwise my eyes are utter shit and I think my eyesight has actually gotten slightly worse
Degan Nestrichal,u have ur permit yet?
Samuel Adams,Permit what's that
Samuel Adams,I'm over 18 I can stroll in and take the test poggers
Degan Nestrichal,unfortunately not..
Degan Nestrichal,being over 18 just means you don't have to take a drivers class
Samuel Adams,How long do you have to have a permit then
Degan Nestrichal,u still have to pass the permit test lol i think ive talked to u about this before
Degan Nestrichal,"there is no required gap between getting a permit and license, they schedule ur driving test after u pass ur permit test"
Degan Nestrichal,so schedule it like RN
Samuel Adams,In that case there's nothing to worry about kek
Samuel Adams,Yeah I should
Samuel Adams,I thought I had to have the permit for like 3 months or something like that
Degan Nestrichal,na i got my permit at 18 then license right after
Degan Nestrichal,took both tests at the same time
Degan Nestrichal,they asked me the written questions while i was driving
Samuel Adams,I guess that's one way to test if you know your shit lmao
Degan Nestrichal,na im kidding
Degan Nestrichal,but they do ask u questions about weird obscure things
Degan Nestrichal,"like the amount of feet u can park between a fire hydrant, what to do if u run into a funeral procession"
Degan Nestrichal,just walk in with this one
Samuel Adams,"Hi, I'm Edward Alexander Chapman-Goodman, and I'd like to renew my permit"
Samuel Adams,Eddie's not a chad donor like I am! What are you gonna do with all of juicy organs when you're dead loser? Haha!
Elijah Parker,sam
Degan Nestrichal,Sam just go to the DMV and say that you're a stranger psychopath surrogate sickness sellout failure faux phenom foolish fantasy fellout deadman doomed delegate doubtful dreaded dropout craven cackling king coiled camera copout
Degan Nestrichal,"all in one breath, then they CANT question you because it sounds like a long muslim name and that would be RACIST"
Samuel Adams,Wisconsin IDs have a special talent to make everyone look like fuckin potatoes
Samuel Adams,I don't know a single person who looks good in their ID photo
Degan Nestrichal,y does austin look like a chad in his
Samuel Adams,All of Illinois's tax dollars go towards making their ID cameras state of the art
Elijah Parker,sam ð
Samuel Adams,Eli why don't you ask Eddie if he wants to talk huh maybe he feels left out
Elijah Parker,He already joined and left cunt.
Degan Nestrichal,sam lets take u on the highway in austins busted manual
Degan Nestrichal,u will learn so much from it
Samuel Adams,I have a sneaking suspicion Eddie and JJ are talking about me and my impulsiveness regarding driving!
JJ Joseph,Perhaps
Degan Nestrichal,join the VC then to discuss driving techniques and how to eat pussy while driving the technique eli would use theoretically if he could drive
Samuel Adams,I have no desire to hear it because you will not deter me from my path
Samuel Adams,If I want to die in a car accident in 21 I wil goddamnit!
Degan Nestrichal,sam what do u do here???
Austin Medina,okay so what the god damn fuck
Degan Nestrichal,ur the happy guy
Austin Medina,"i went back to autozone and grabbed the civic, it started and idled rough again but i was able to drive it hom"
Degan Nestrichal,were they supposed to fix it?
Austin Medina,"no lol, it just broke down in their parking lot so i was gonna leave it there over night"
Austin Medina,i got it home tho so i just gotta figure out why its idling rough
Degan Nestrichal,austin the scientist
Austin Medina,i think i should start with pulling the spark plugs maybe
Degan Nestrichal,yo austin u should cop the porsche GT cruzer
Austin Medina,i should
Samuel Adams,In that situation you kick rocks and wonder why you didn't get into the right turn lane
Degan Nestrichal,where does it say its a right turn lane?
Degan Nestrichal,this is 1 lane
Austin Medina,imma teach sam to  drive and be aggressive as fuck in traffic
Degan Nestrichal,omg yas so his insurance rates go BRRR!
Austin Medina,why would his insurance go up if he doesnt get caught
Degan Nestrichal,find out how this fucker has an insurance rate of $0
Degan Nestrichal,and is literally having sex with ur imaginary wife
Austin Medina,i wonder if my catalytic converter is clogged
JJ Joseph,Lmao every ticket accident etc will increase you insurance
Austin Medina,just dont crash and dont get tickets
Degan Nestrichal,austin did u know that being a domestic terrorist technically doesn't raise ur car insurance
Austin Medina,if u dont get caught i guess
Samuel Adams,JJ's gonna start monitoring this chat just to correct me when I say something wrong about driving
Samuel Adams,If that's the only way to get him to actually participate I welcome it
Austin Medina,anyway if the cat isnt clogged im thinking maybe the oil i added caused the pressure to rise and then this added oil pressure is causing more oil to squeeze into the cylinders via valve seals and piston rings and could be coating the ground electrode on one of the spark plugs and preventing proper spark
Austin Medina,could be a vacuum leak too or something
Austin Medina,water in the fuel maybe
Austin Medina,idfk
Austin Medina,im going to bed wish me luck bros
Samuel Adams,Come over I have a doohickey scanner tool
Samuel Adams,We will find out what's wrong with the civic
Degan Nestrichal,pov: u hang with the quiet kids after school
Samuel Adams,Which one's Rande and which one's J
J Cole Patt,join vc now!!!

Degan Nestrichal,im sleeping zzz
Degan Nestrichal,me sleepy time zzz
Samuel Adams,Civic is dead
Austin Medina,I think it could just need a cat lol
Degan Nestrichal,"austin b like ye the civic works, just needs a new engine, sam u wanna cop for $1.9k discount price?"
Austin Medina,I'm going to troubleshoot it when I get home
Austin Medina,The troubleshooting may or may not involve drilling some holes in my catalytic converter
Samuel Adams,Austin be like fug bro you can learn manual through this!
Degan Nestrichal,holy fuck its sam teaching java! its a white dude with glasses!
Austin Medina,Holy fuck i just took a ride in that 5.0 mustang that thing has wayyyyy too much power
Austin Medina,Shit was sliding and drifting all over lmao
Elijah Parker,Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?
Degan Nestrichal,"oh no austin is talking to his phone again, looks like dementia got to him early - Austins coworkers, probs"
Samuel Adams,"My IS teacher really said ""This assignment has sent students to the hospital with panic attacks"""
Samuel Adams,Took me maybe 2 hours to do
Samuel Adams,Either I'm good at working with databases or he's full of shit
Elijah Parker,Full of shite lad
Degan Nestrichal,try spending 36 hrs making a memory allocator!
Elijah Parker,Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?
Elijah Parker,"This one does not know, but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold :(:("
Samuel Adams,Is anyone in the market for a CRT HDTV
Samuel Adams,If you help me get it out of the house and into your car it's yours to keep lmao

Degan Nestrichal,you know what FUCK YOU sam i dont want it anyways!
Samuel Adams,With extension cord for scale kek
Samuel Adams,This is a heavy mf
Degan Nestrichal,ah yes perfect i will play all my NES and gamecube games here
Degan Nestrichal,wait no this is my 3rd monitor actually perfect
Degan Nestrichal,this is where i will watch all the hentai
Samuel Adams,The only practical reason to own this thing is to play NES games in their native resolution
Samuel Adams,Otherwise it's unwieldy and quite frankly I'd probably have to pay someone to take it lmao
Degan Nestrichal,wut kind of ports does it have
Samuel Adams,Looks like there's one HDMI port and that's it lmao
Degan Nestrichal,very surprised it even has one
Samuel Adams,There's no remote for it either but a universal one costs like 7 bucks
Samuel Adams,In fact if one of you guys actually wanted it is probably go ahead and order one
Degan Nestrichal,Guys lets play a game of who said that
Degan Nestrichal,"""For necrophilia, it might be necessary to ask the next of kin for permission if the decedent's will did not authorize it. Necrophilia would be my second choice for what should be done with my corpse, the first being scientific or medical use. Once my dead body is no longer of any use to me, it may as well be of some use to someone. Besides, I often enjoy rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with dead plants)."""
Degan Nestrichal,fuck i just realized u NEETS can google this
Samuel Adams,So wait for a driving test they have you take the vision test without your glasses lmao
Samuel Adams,I literally don't think I could do it my eyes are that shit
Austin Medina,No they dont lmao
Samuel Adams,So my dad's talking out of his ass again
Austin Medina,Why would they test you without your glasses if you wear them for every other aspect of your life
Austin Medina,They test you with your glasses if you were them while driving
Austin Medina,Wear*
Austin Medina,Sorry sam! You got punked
Samuel Adams,I mean I probably still need a better prescription
Austin Medina,Also after talking to my mechanic buddy in chicago i have some ideas on what to check on the honda
Samuel Adams,Somehow my eyes are getting slightly worse
Austin Medina,Same but fug it
Austin Medina,dont worry about anything sam just do it bro lmao
Degan Nestrichal,can confirm they test corrected vision
Degan Nestrichal,yall ever let out the loudest moan while driving with the windows down
Degan Nestrichal,half expecting some dude to mug u from teh backseat after u wake him up
Degan Nestrichal,i think the CIA is on to me i keep seeing green figures at night
Degan Nestrichal,im starting to really think you guys are all NPCs and i am like Naruto
Elijah Parker,Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?
Degan Nestrichal,yeah this Elijah guy is definitely a NPC deployed by the CIA to fuck with me
Elijah Parker,"This one does not know, but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold :(:("
Degan Nestrichal,no meme at first glance this looks like sam
Degan Nestrichal,did u guys see that blake lost weight?
Degan Nestrichal,this is what he looks like now
Degan Nestrichal,alright goodnight NPCs
Elijah Parker,Can you believe it? Dragons! In your own homeland! What are you going to do?
Elijah Parker,"This one does not know, but he hopes his family is safe in Riverhold :(:("
J Cole Patt,"Do you get to the cloud district often? Oh what am I kidding, of course not."
Elijah Parker,"I'll have you know, there's no pusssssieeeeeee."
Degan Nestrichal,ok goodnight NPCs
Elijah Parker,â¸®od ot gniog uoy era tahW !dnalemoh nwo ruoy nI !snogarD â¸®ti eveileb uoy naC
Elijah Parker,"Este nÃ£o sabe, mas espera que sua famÃ­lia esteja segura em Riverhold :(:("
Elijah Parker,Fuck sorry. I'm glitching bro
Samuel Adams,Mark my words I will cop this
Samuel Adams,Fuck dude this accord is clean
Samuel Adams,If I had the cash I would literally buy it tomorrow lmao
Austin Medina,"It's nice but always shop around, there's better deals"
Samuel Adams,I wagered for an 09 with that mileage and the work that the guy claims to have done to it that's a fair price
Austin Medina,"That is fair, but if you read carefully all thats been done really is brakes and tune up with newish tires"
Austin Medina,What i would do is actually bring a mechanic or me with and let me check some of this shit out
Samuel Adams,Damn you Austin what ever happened to letting me foolishly spend my money I don't want to think about the money I spend!
Austin Medina,It is a 4 banger tho so really reliable and gas effiecient
Austin Medina,Well i mean if u want it
Samuel Adams,Fug bro just found a PT Cruiser with 101k miles on it for 12k I'm gonna buy it
Austin Medina,I would inquire about the timing service and obviously check all de fluids and such
Austin Medina,If its a manual pt gt do it
Samuel Adams,I loathe PT cruisers I wouldn't be caught dead with one of those lmao
Austin Medina,Pt gt is fast it could smoke that accord
Samuel Adams,Here's the dealer my dad wants to hook me up with btw
Austin Medina,Lemme see
Samuel Adams,Focuses have such low resale value hmmmmmmm
Austin Medina,It's a commuter car really so ye
Samuel Adams,Yeah most of this shit is priced well beyond plausibility atm
Austin Medina,They want too much money but they have a nice manual accord
Samuel Adams,I am not willing to finance a car at this stage of my life lmao
Austin Medina,Yeah dealerships think they can charge ridiculous amounts for whatever reason
Austin Medina,My job wants 7k for an automatic v6 mustang with like 70k miles
Austin Medina,Its also about 20 years old
Samuel Adams,I don't know what the friends and family discount will get me but I doubt it'll get me anything other than a focus or fusion lol
Austin Medina,Yeah not rly worth
Austin Medina,"The only car i would have ever bought from my job was a 2006 Lexus is250, it was really great they wanted like 10 stacks"
Austin Medina,"But its awd, heated seats nice interior and actually low miles"
Austin Medina,It sold within a day lmao
Samuel Adams,I guess the fact that these cars are all routinely less than 10 years old is a plus
Austin Medina,Idk shit about ford sedans
Austin Medina,My guy tom works at the ford dealership tho so if you need work done i can get you a good mechanic
Samuel Adams,My dads 08 focus has held up for 10 years and still has less than 100k miles
Samuel Adams,It's also a manual and he doesn't beat up the transmission
Austin Medina,"Thats good, yeah more so on your dads driving habits"
Samuel Adams,I wouldn't want that car doe it's a 2D and cramped as fuck
Austin Medina,"I would highly recommend tho, camry corolla civic or accore"
Austin Medina,Accord
Samuel Adams,The four horsemen of reliable sedans
Austin Medina,And then after that crv or rav4
Austin Medina,If u want suv
Austin Medina,"And then i guess a subaru is decent, just make sure it hasnt been beat on and no headgasket failures"
Austin Medina,"But as long as its like a legacy or a forester, people dont really beat on em"
Austin Medina,Any subie that has been modded is probably beat to fuck
Samuel Adams,Austin rest assured we will go car shopping
Austin Medina,Fuck yeah niggus
Samuel Adams,And slowly but surely I will find the whip of my nascent college year dreams
Austin Medina,I mean
Austin Medina,If u got 5800 for an accord
Samuel Adams,03 Civic with 382k miles
Austin Medina,You got 5800 for a mustang gt
Samuel Adams,Lmao fuck
Samuel Adams,You're gonna talk me into buying a mustang
Austin Medina,Or a built integra but then you would want it in manual
Samuel Adams,Vroom vroom
Austin Medina,Mustangs are cool i plan on getting one one day even tho my grandpa may disown me
Austin Medina,Maybe i should buy a camaro ss
Samuel Adams,Everyone with a working penis knows Ford > Chevy
Austin Medina,"This is about heritage, my grandpa has a chevelle ss with the 454 v8"
Austin Medina,It's godly
Austin Medina,"Also if I'm gonna work at a gm dealership, ill know how to work on them from exposure"
Samuel Adams,You wanna go get this Austin
Samuel Adams,I will get unlimited road head in a 67 mustang
Austin Medina,Loolllll idk seems it would be hard to repair considering its like 54 years old
Austin Medina,"That's something to consider, some older albeit cool cars might be hard to get parts for"
Samuel Adams,Lmao yeah I wouldn't bother unless I had real money
Samuel Adams,So what the fuck is wrong with mustangs to make them so cheap
Austin Medina,Automatic v6 with so many miles
Austin Medina,Thats basically a ford fusion
Samuel Adams,Kek
Austin Medina,If you get a mustang you want one with a v8
Austin Medina,"The mid 90s up to like 2010 had a 4.6L v8, after that theyre 5.0L and the price goes up"
Austin Medina,What i do to look at mustangs is just basically go on and put manual as the only qualifier
Austin Medina,"So maybe mustang can be fun second car you get down the road, if you need some time to learn manual"
Samuel Adams,Why is FB marketplace so much more ergonomic on mobile

Samuel Adams,This is a problem for someone with significantly more money than me

Samuel Adams,Now do GM cars
Samuel Adams,Except in reverse where price rises for a significantly worse product xd xd
Austin Medina,If you find an old buick like 90s or early 2000s thats been owned by old folks
Austin Medina,Cop that shit
Austin Medina,Those are so reliable and have nice interiors with heated seats
Austin Medina,"Theres a reason old folks bought those buicks, because theyre simple and comfy"
Austin Medina,"Now modern cars as a whole are not simple lol, but yeah early 2000s gm products honestly not so bad"
Samuel Adams,I'd cop an old lesabre they have a rustic appeal to them
Austin Medina,Ive had times where we were dropping off somebodys 2003 buick lucerne with 40k miles and im cruising back like shit i should offer this 87 year old some money for this car
Samuel Adams,Lmao that reminds me my great grandpa had an old Oldsmobile and i wish I was car aware before they got rid of it
Austin Medina,With that i say goodnight I'll message you all tmrw
Samuel Adams,Goodnight brudder
Austin Medina,Back in the saddle boys i fixed da honda
Degan Nestrichal,lets gooo austin the experimentalist physicist

Degan Nestrichal,"im just saying driving fast doesnt make u cool austin, money does!"

Elijah Parker,"Austin be like ""bro I know I don't have a garage but why not buy 15 cars bro?"""
Degan Nestrichal,right what a fucking dumbass god i fucking hate austin so much
Elijah Parker,God FUCKING damn it Austin.
Samuel Adams,Tried out driving manual for a little bit
Samuel Adams,The clutch is OP
Austin Medina,You stalled a lot right
Samuel Adams,Lmao yeah I realize why though
Samuel Adams,Breaking without pressing in the clutch means you force the engine to essentially shut off
Austin Medina,Yeppp
Austin Medina,"I throw it into neutral if im coming to a complete stop, you can slow down with your brakes but if you start to seem like youre gonna stall you gotta downshift."
Samuel Adams,I unfortunately have to give it to Eddie he's fucking right that it's hard to get used to things unless you have kinesthetic experience lmao
Austin Medina,This is true of most things
Austin Medina,So how did it go with getting going from a complete stop
Samuel Adams,"It was interesting, I realized that the clutch isn't all or nothing either"
Austin Medina,Yeah no its a progressive thing
Samuel Adams,There's a sweet spot where the engine and transmission lock on to each other
Austin Medina,Thats how you creep in a manual car
Austin Medina,"I took the honda to honada yesterday, so glad it made the drive lol"
Samuel Adams,I recall revving it before it actually engaged and then for some reason I thought it was gonna take off so I breaked and that's when it stalled the first time
Samuel Adams,Forgot it wasn't an automatic in that moment lmao
Austin Medina,"You can rev it before it engaged, sometimes i do that on hills i set the rev and then slowly let out the clutch so when it catches it doesnt stall and i end up going backwards lol"
Samuel Adams,"Yee and I realized that's the premise throttle blipping works on as well, like I said clutch is OP kek"
Austin Medina,"Fasho, thats cool tho if you can get comfy with a manual, you have the option of getting a lot more vehicles"
Samuel Adams,My mom could never get used to driving a manual because she breaks with her left foot lmao
Austin Medina,Thats a horrible habit lmao
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna assume she's done it her entire life so it would probably be ass to get her to do anything else
Austin Medina,My niece started doing that so i got on her about it lmao
Samuel Adams,Oh fug bro I'm really excited! Lemme hit the gas and brake at the same time!
Samuel Adams,"Apparently this is an actual technique in rally racing, it keeps the turbo active"
Degan Nestrichal,"Yeah getting used to manuevering a car takes a bit, its not very intuitive at first"
Degan Nestrichal,then u eventually build the muscle memory and go through the motions to the point where all u need to focus on is traffic
Samuel Adams,"What I realized is that even though you can be correct on what certain things do, you have to know how to do them in the first place"
Samuel Adams,Application of the theory behind it n all that
Degan Nestrichal,yeah some things are impossible to learn in theory
Degan Nestrichal,I could sit here and tell u how to code in c for 2 weeks but until u actually practice and code yourself u wont even know how to reverse an array!
Degan Nestrichal,"for(int i = size; i >= 0; i--) {  strncat(builder, str + i, 1); }"
Degan Nestrichal,mfs be like wut dat mean xD
Samuel Adams,Austin how would you rate Hyundai's
Austin Medina,What car specifically
Samuel Adams,My dads trying to get me to buy a 2012 accent with 187k miles
Samuel Adams,It's 4200
Samuel Adams,"I personally wouldn't wanna get it, it looks kinda dopey and I don't know how much longer the car would last with that kind of mileage lol"
Austin Medina,Do you have a listing for it
Samuel Adams,Besides that Avalon has a 3.5L V6 ð¥´
Austin Medina,Avalon?
Samuel Adams,Lemme fetch that listing
Austin Medina,Damn bro why is your dad so insistent on going to the middle of indiana for a car lmao
Samuel Adams,Because I can apparently get a good discount from this dude
Austin Medina,The avalon is a much better option to be honest
Austin Medina,"I dont really know a whole lot about hyundais but toyotas just last, that v6 is more desirable to me but idk how much you care about that performance aspect"
Austin Medina,Just buy a camry from some vato on facebook
Austin Medina,You can get a decent car for like 2 or 3k
Samuel Adams,"I tried explaining that aspect to them lmao, when you see old cars on the world they're generally Toyotas"
Austin Medina,"But i mean if ur sold on the idea of buying a car from this dealership, could be a good thing if you can really actually get a decent discount"
Samuel Adams,"Thing is, I'm not really sold on it but my parents are convinced this is the wisest thing to do"
Austin Medina,"If you want something reliable, i mean... jeep cherokee with the straight 6"
Austin Medina,Great for winter time
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna buy that off you and then it'll shit itself guaranteed ð
Austin Medina,I see the jeep making it to 200k miles no cap lmao
Austin Medina,"Ill probably keep it that long too, assuming i dont move to a warm weather climate"
Samuel Adams,What's it at rn?
Austin Medina,151k
Austin Medina,Ive been driving it again recently because honda but now the hondas alive and well again
Samuel Adams,I'll give you 2k and a happy ending for it
Austin Medina,Lemme see if my guy tom wants to sell one of his he has two
Austin Medina,"Also generally if you're going to get a Jeep product and you want it to be really reliable get it with manual locks and windows and everything like that, manula seats too. Those do not break lmao"
Austin Medina,"That kind of goes for all cars, the less features you can deal with the less things will break"
Austin Medina,Buy this rn im not even joking
Austin Medina,Excellent car
Austin Medina,@Samuel Adams
Austin Medina,Ill come with you to look at it if you want
Austin Medina,"Comes with a really good engine that i actually know about, its a b20 series"
Samuel Adams,Holy shit
Samuel Adams,I'd love to snag this
Austin Medina,You got money rn?
Samuel Adams,My only problem is I'm waiting for a live check to arrive at my doorstep and that could take a while
Austin Medina,Ahhhh shit
Austin Medina,Okay lemme know when you got shmonies
Samuel Adams,Which is why all of these great cars that I might scout around for will be gone by the time I get my dough
Austin Medina,Theres always good deals just gotta sniff em out
Degan Nestrichal,ah shit bro sam u should get the uh.. car
Degan Nestrichal,the one with the uh.. miles.. and uh.. yeah
Degan Nestrichal,"just spin back the odometer, it does the trick"
Austin Medina,Thats nothing i saw a 2016 suburban with 220k miles on it at work
Austin Medina,Mfs drove the hell out of that car
Degan Nestrichal,ah shit bro just copped a 2021 GMC Yukon for $500 in google play cards

Degan Nestrichal,Yo eddie pass me that fucking fireball
Elijah Parker,Thanks bro
Elijah Parker,Y'all wanna ciggie?
Samuel Adams,"My dad when I don't buy from the dealership he's shilling: And if you love what you've done, you'll never be satisfied!"
Austin Medina,"Im sure that accent is decent, great gas mileage i bet but yeah its kinda ugly lol"
Samuel Adams,I can never forgive myself if I don't buy a car capable of comfy booze cruising for the backseat passengers
Austin Medina,"If thats what u want, a crv or a rav4 would be dank, they get good gas mileage still"
Samuel Adams,"Save me, save me, from the horrors Facebook sells!"
Austin Medina,That red crv is so clean im tempted to message the guy lol
Samuel Adams,Oh fuk am I gonna have to take the test in my dad's focus lmao
Samuel Adams,The escape doesn't have wisconsin plates
Austin Medina,Cant you take it in any car
Austin Medina,As long as its wisco plates
Austin Medina,Take it in eddies forenza lmao
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna call em up today and just ask them what's what
Samuel Adams,I'm tryna get my license before June so if I can get all of the other shit out of the way before then that'd be pog
Austin Medina,"I would hope you could take it in the escape tbh, idk why the plates would matter as long as you demonstrate you can drive"
Austin Medina,Ill take you driving when we chill you at keno for a while?
Samuel Adams,I'm back at marquette but I'm actually coming back this weekend kek
Samuel Adams,For Easter
Austin Medina,If you're free any day I could take you driving in the Jeep
Samuel Adams,"That would be sick, I could probably arrange to be free Friday or Saturday"
Degan Nestrichal,they dont even check for registration or insurance
Degan Nestrichal,"as long as the brake lights, turn signals, horn, etc. work"
Austin Medina,Yeah pretty much they didn't even ask me if it was insured or anything when I did mine
Degan Nestrichal,ur dad hasnt taken the test in milennias y does he think he knows
Degan Nestrichal,ok boomie ð¹
Austin Medina,Yeah wait hasn't he never taken it
Degan Nestrichal,o even worse
Degan Nestrichal,i forgot about that
Austin Medina,"Dude Sam by this Geo Metro it's got 248,000 miles and no power steering and the max speed is 85 miles an hour"
Degan Nestrichal,holy fk im gonna turn into eli looking head ass
Degan Nestrichal,y cant i just have long hair like john lenny
Samuel Adams,My hair blows in the breeze excessively
Samuel Adams,"I want a 1981 Ford Pinto with 392,000 miles and a rotted out trunk!"
Austin Medina,You can get that for 200 bucks
Austin Medina,Yeah why dont you just buy a shit box bro
Austin Medina,Like a fuckin ford festiva lmao
Samuel Adams,Time to buy a 96 Dodge Neon
Samuel Adams,"My dad be like ""Let's put that in a 3000GT"""
Austin Medina,Lmao hell yeah mf!
Austin Medina,Yeah just buy a shitbox man you can learn a lot about yourself and cars
Samuel Adams,I'll learn a whole bunch about cars when my chrysler sebring breaks down within 45 minutes of purchasing it
Degan Nestrichal,oh no sams gonna turn into an insufferable car guy
Degan Nestrichal,rip his brain
Austin Medina,I mean if ur curious about fixing or understanding your car
Samuel Adams,Jokes on you Eddie! I'm already insufferable!
Austin Medina,Its good to know even basic shit like how to change a bulb and wiper blades
Samuel Adams,Austin when I get my car do you wanna do the first oil change on it bb ;)
Austin Medina,Depends what car it is
Degan Nestrichal,i know how to change a tire but dats about it mf xD
Degan Nestrichal,a car is merely a means of convenience!
Samuel Adams,A computer is a means of convenience mf xD xD
Samuel Adams,This dude gonna start using binary punch cards to communicate with us! Down with convenience!
Austin Medina,This nigga eddie gonna hand tighten the lug nuts!
Degan Nestrichal,"a car just lets u go places, if u could teleport they would be useless"
Degan Nestrichal,a computer is a means for many different things
Samuel Adams,Even if I could teleport I'd still want to drive a car
Samuel Adams,He doesn't get it Austin! The sheer thrill of driving is appreciable even separated from its convenience!
Degan Nestrichal,"and no a car is just a liability, a computer isnt!"
Degan Nestrichal,imagine if u had to get computer insurance xD
Samuel Adams,Computer insurance is just an elevated electric bill :(
Degan Nestrichal,gas + insurance + maintenance
Degan Nestrichal,100x > a few dollars in electricity
Degan Nestrichal,if even that
Degan Nestrichal,mines is a gold rated efficiency powersupply with a 250W GPU
Degan Nestrichal,"sam you've driven for maybe an hour collectively, you havent even had time to see how monotonous it gets!"
Austin Medina,Buy a honda civic
Degan Nestrichal,a riced manny civic mmm
Degan Nestrichal,sam just had an aneurysm or somethng
Degan Nestrichal,i had to mentally read that aloud to make sense of it
Samuel Adams,Texting while walking is so stressful!
Austin Medina,Lol why are you walking somewhere just drive
Degan Nestrichal,dats y u text and drive its way less stressful and epic
Degan Nestrichal,lmfao right austin this mf still walking when cars been invented ðð
Samuel Adams,Mfs when cars were invented: âWhat's gonna happen to the horse and buggy industry? ðâ
Degan Nestrichal,wait so r u taking the test in an auto or manual
Degan Nestrichal,and did u schedule ur permit test yet?
Degan Nestrichal,cuz yeah they legit dont check anything except the condition of the car
Degan Nestrichal,if u get a guy on ur driving test ur basically guaranteed to pass
Samuel Adams,I'm gonna call the DMV today
Samuel Adams,I'll ask if I can take the test in a car with Illinois plates just to clarify kek
Austin Medina,If you can i would gladly let you borrow el jeepo
Degan Nestrichal,id be weary of taking it in a car ur unfamiliar with
Degan Nestrichal,i cant remember if i ever told u guys but i did fail my first time cuz i went in a friends GMC acadia rather than my car cuz i was worried they might ask for insurance
Degan Nestrichal,it was also a lady instructor so i was doomed either way
Degan Nestrichal,OMG u braked too close! automatic fail!
Samuel Adams,DMV be like lmao get better noob! Oh wait you can't because that'd be illegal without a license LOL!
Degan Nestrichal,bruh i took the next test shortly after and got like 8 marks compared to fkin like 32 before
Degan Nestrichal,it was a beefy dude with a beard
Samuel Adams,I think I heard about this dude
Samuel Adams,Did he look like santa claus
Degan Nestrichal,nah nah it wasnt him
Degan Nestrichal,i know who ur talking about
Degan Nestrichal,but yeah if they dont like u they will legit just lie about certain points
Degan Nestrichal,"also dont run an uncontrolled intersection, slow down"
Degan Nestrichal,i think if u run those its an automatic fail
Degan Nestrichal,an uncontrolled intersection exists really only in suburban areas where there is such little traffic that there is no stop sign or yield sign at an intersection
Samuel Adams,Have they devised such a route where you have to interact with every little unique thing on the road lol
Degan Nestrichal,"the route goes something like this: you reverse out of the parking lot (make sure you go the right way, its a 1 way parking lot), turn right out of the DMV, turn left onto a big main street, turn right into a street that leads into a suburb (do NOT pour into the bike line), turn left into the suburb, then you drive around the suburb, make a Y-turn, answer some questions about parking on a hill, get out of the suburb, then TURN left on a main street to circle back around to the DMV"
Degan Nestrichal,"u also have to do traffic checks at each intersection, so make exaggerated head movements"
Degan Nestrichal,also make the most autistic head movements when doing ur Y turn
Austin Medina,Yeah definitelt whenever you mirror or shoulder check make very exaggerated movements lmao
Austin Medina,Take the test in this!
Austin Medina,Its like damn near two of my hondas in length
Samuel Adams,"Sorry instructor, I just HAVE to drop the clutch in this bad boy"
Degan Nestrichal,"they gonna be like, aight since u pulled up in this swag ride, we are gonna ask u to parallel park"
Degan Nestrichal,oh ye the answer the parking hill question is a bit unintuitive its turn ur wheel RIGHT downhill and LEFT uphill
Austin Medina,Yeah so the car would if anything hit the curb and stop or just go off road should it roll
Samuel Adams,Time to read the motorists handbook guys! I'm excited!
Degan Nestrichal,theres this one quiz app i think i used way back
Degan Nestrichal,look up Wisconsin DMV permit test on app store it should be the first one
Degan Nestrichal,i think thats all i used to prepare
Samuel Adams,Lmao it has a one star rating
Degan Nestrichal,it goes over some of the specific questions with numbers and stuff
Austin Medina,I never even read any of that kind of shit
Degan Nestrichal,austin quick what is this??
Samuel Adams,It's 150 feet duh!
Austin Medina,Doesnt matter just give the trucker some space
Degan Nestrichal,exactly but on the test u have to know austin
Austin Medina,None of this textbook ship matters unless you dry properly you can know all this shit and still drive like a fuckin retard
Degan Nestrichal,its a written test austinian
Samuel Adams,Most people study for this like anything and then promptly forget all of it
Samuel Adams,What sticks is what you apply in the real world
Austin Medina,Thats gay
Austin Medina,Is this for the permit
Degan Nestrichal,yes
Degan Nestrichal,u had to take this at some point austin lmao
Austin Medina,In illinois it just asks you some basic shit like road sign meanings and how early you had to use your blinker but yeah i mean im sure i knew what it all was at some point
Degan Nestrichal,i dont remember any of it now
Degan Nestrichal,u have to get like 45/50
Degan Nestrichal,i think
Degan Nestrichal,signs is a separate test with 18/20
Degan Nestrichal,then vision test
Samuel Adams,Me basking in the superiority of not having a license
Degan Nestrichal,more like inferiority LOL!!!! me and austin are so fucking cool
Degan Nestrichal,omg eli is smoking a ciggie how poggie
Samuel Adams,28 minutes to wait on a phone call at the dmv you got me fucked up
Samuel Adams,It's probably quicker to go in person lmao
Elijah Parker,It's not.
Elijah Parker,I can promise you that much mate.
Samuel Adams,They're gonna close in 30 minutes anyway
Elijah Parker,I went at a thursday at like 9 AM to get my learners permit and it was packed to the brim with niggas.
Samuel Adams,Did you take the written test Eli
Elijah Parker,It's wasn't written when I was there.
Samuel Adams,Lmao fug what'd you have to do then
Elijah Parker,It was like a fucking PowerPoint slide show with multiple choice answers.
Elijah Parker,Totally digital matey.
Austin Medina,"Yeah it might be all computerized now, in il thats how mine was"
Elijah Parker,And believe me if a nigga who doesn't care about cars or has no interest in driving it was stupidly easy.
Samuel Adams,So getting the permit is piss easy then
Elijah Parker,A breeze yeah.
Austin Medina,"The best way to go about the dmv is to go at the ass crack of down right as they open, eventhen there will probably be a line"
Elijah Parker,You've just gotta deal with the long lines and shit.
Samuel Adams,Guys I know what I'm gonna do this weekend! Poggers!
Austin Medina,Ill be your dad and take you if your folks are busy
Elijah Parker,I'm gonna be kicking it with London probably all weekend because ð
Samuel Adams,Did you have to schedule that in advance Eli
Degan Nestrichal,sam u have a normal ID card rite?
Degan Nestrichal,im tryna remember i think u might just be able to walk in there and take a written test but i honestly forget
Degan Nestrichal,cuz i dont even remember scheduling a written test now that i think of it
J Cole Patt,if u dont go to the v right when it opens good luck
J Cole Patt,dmv
Samuel Adams,"I have my ID, my social security card, I can procure my birth certificate and proof of address pretty easily"
Degan Nestrichal,kenosha one isnt that bad tbh
J Cole Patt,ah
Elijah Parker,Nah bruv I just walked in.
Elijah Parker,I mean idk if you can call ahead.
Degan Nestrichal,personally longest ive had to wait was <15 mins
Elijah Parker,I didn't see like. Two separate lines.
Samuel Adams,I wasn't gonna bother if that's the case lol
Samuel Adams,Did yall have to bring all of those pertinent documents to get the permit or nah
Elijah Parker,Nah.
Degan Nestrichal,honestly its been a while i cant exactly remember
Elijah Parker,You need to know your SSN.
Degan Nestrichal,i think u need 2 forms?
Elijah Parker,Oh yeah you need a proof of address too yeah.
Elijah Parker,So like a thing of mail.
Degan Nestrichal,eli can u just walk in there and take the test i dont even remember
Elijah Parker,"But as long as you have your state ID, have proof of address and know your SSN that's all I walked in with."
Samuel Adams,So you got your permit that day then or do you have to wait for it
Elijah Parker,You've gotta wait for your plastic one to come in the mail.
Austin Medina,Waukegan dmv is really fucked because a lot of townships and villages go to it due to them not having their iwn
Elijah Parker,But if you NEED one asap you can get a paper one that works just the same for the time being.
Austin Medina,Just get the paper one then imo lol
Elijah Parker,It only takes like 3 days to get to you.
Elijah Parker,But yeah if you wanna go whipping it I'd get a paper one for the time being.
Elijah Parker,You've had mail sent to your house right sam?
Samuel Adams,Oh yeah I have a proof of address somewhere at my house
Samuel Adams,I know my SSN and I have my ID so yeah I'm gucci
Elijah Parker,Alright good shit. Then yeah all you need is your ID and that then they'll have you fill out your paperwork and then wait once again until there's a compooter open for you.
Samuel Adams,Have you scheduled a road test my boy
Samuel Adams,I can't let Eli get a license before I do! Fuck!
Elijah Parker,You won't.

Elijah Parker,"Like I'd be ""hitting"" an enemy but not actually hitting it and I'd be so confused why."
Samuel Adams,Morrowind be like: 0/100 fatigue 24/7
Elijah Parker,They really don't explain that your hit chance is based on your skill in a tree.
Elijah Parker,That too.
Elijah Parker,I liked that you played as the other kind of khajiit though.
Elijah Parker,The non flat footed ones.
Elijah Parker,Really made them feel more like cats imo
Elijah Parker,The walking is so fucking goofy in morrowind though ð­ð­ð­ð­ð­ð­
Elijah Parker,Bow legged ass niggas everywhere
Samuel Adams,So wait Austin are you actually down to take ya boy to the DMV at the ass crack of dawn because I'll cover fuckin breakfast and/or coffee if you're down kek
Samuel Adams,"Oh yeah, I thought it was fuckin interesting that argonians and khajiit couldn't wear boots in morrowind"
Elijah Parker,That too yeah. That was more immersive
Elijah Parker,ESO is going offline tomorrow morning for maintenance.
Elijah Parker,Not the walking either my b the running. The running animations at least for Khajiit look ridiculous lmfao

Samuel Adams,What do you mean
Samuel Adams,Tuning up is generally ill-advised
Samuel Adams,"But there are a few tunings where I've had to tune my B up to C and it was fine, like the Rain Song"

Degan Nestrichal,"lol imagine using a dynamically typed language, how cringe!"
Degan Nestrichal,"python is fun af tho, its good for everything except building software"
Degan Nestrichal,"fun fact sam the main thing that separates normie grandma languages like python from fat neckbeard languages like c/c++/c#/java is the fact that they are dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare the type of your variables, the interpreter will figure it out for you as the program runs"
Degan Nestrichal,"and the fact that its not compiled, only interpreted"
Degan Nestrichal,python and javascript*
Samuel Adams,"I figured that out after a while, I was caught up in defining my variables and then I was like fuk I don't actually have to do this python is just big brained"
